(57) Abstract : 
Systems and methodologies of intelligently selecting and advertising antenna ports to UEs (e.g., advertising a number of antenna ports 
to legacy UEs, and another number of antenna ports to new UEs). Such adaptive feature in adjusting the number of antenna ports, 
enables the base station(s) to intelligently balance requirements of legacy UEs and new UEs (e.g., LTE-A) for an overall efficient 
operation of the wireless system take as a whole - (e.g., performance gain for new users is deemed an offset for performance 
degradation for legacy users.) Accordingly, resources that are typically reserved for a Reference Signal (RS) associated with an 
antenna port, can be freed when such antenna ports are not advertised to the UEs as part of wireless system operation.
