(57) Abstract : 
A public key cryptographic system and method is provided for a password or any other predefined personal secret information that 
defeats key factoring and spoofing attacks. The method adopts a new technique of encrypting a password or any predefined secret 
information by a numeric function of itself, replacing the fixed public key of the conventional RSA encryption. The whole process 
involving key generation, encryption, decryption and password handling is discussed in detail. Mathematical and cryptanalytical 
proofs of defeating factoring and spoofing attacks are furnished.
