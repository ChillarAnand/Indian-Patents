Abstract  =>  The durability of a transparent pyrolytic spray applied coating is improved by providing a spray solution of metal acetylacetonates having different particle size distribution. More particularly, the particle size distribution of each of the metal acetylacetonates is a function of its melting temperature, and optionally of its melting temperature and solubility.
