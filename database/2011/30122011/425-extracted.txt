(57) Abstract : 
A solid fuel powder combustion system and a method thereof are revealed. By means of a hermetic helical feeder that prevents high 
pressure combustion gas from leaking along the combustor to a shaft of a helical fan inside a closed housing, solid fuel powder is fed 
into an open cycle gas turbine system for combustion. Then combustion gas generated by combustion enters a gas turbine and expands 
to do work and generate power.
