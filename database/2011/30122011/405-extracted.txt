(57) Abstract : 
Switching apparatus having a rotary knob (28) for operating a latching mechanism of an installation switching device having at least 
one upper housing wall (12) wherein the latching mechanism comprises a catch mechanism with a catch lever (32) which can be 
moved between a latched and an unlatched position, wherein the rotary knob (28) can assume a switched-on and a switched-off 
position corresponding to the switch position of the latching mechanism and, in the switched-on position, the force of a spring (25) 
acts on the rotary knob (28) in the direction of the switched-off position, and wherein, on tripping, the catch mechanism is unlatched 
and the catch lever (32) can be moved from the latched position to the unlatched position, and, when the rotary knob (28) is reset to 
the switched-off position, the catch mechanism is latched again, wherein a control journal (26), which can be moved between a 
latched position and an unlatched position, interacts with the catch lever (32) and the rotary knob (28) and, on tripping, can be moved 
from its latched position to its unlatched position, in which it holds the rotary knob (28) in a trip position between the switched-on and 
the switched-off position, and prevents the catch lever (32) from returning to the latched position, wherein the control journal (26) has 
an unlatching and a latching zone (34, 38) as well as a pin projection (24) which passes through the upper housing wall (12), and that 
side of the rotary knob (28) which faces the upper housing wall (12) has a holding pocket (46) which holds the pin projection (24). 
The holding pocket (46) has a clamping apparatus (48) for detachably holding the pin projection (24), and has a control incline (50) 
which is adjacent to the clamping apparatus (48) in the twisting direction of the rotary knob (28), wherein the mutual arrangement of 
the control journal (26), of the rotary knob (28) and of the catch lever (32) is designed such that, during tripping, the pin projection 
(24) is clamped by the clamping apparatus (48) and thus holds the rotary knob (28) in the trip position, and that, when the rotary knob 
(28) is moved from the trip position to the switched-off position, the clamping apparatus (48) releases the pin projection (24) and the 
rotary knob pushes the pin projection (24) via the control incline (50) so far into the housing that the catch lever (32) can engage with 
the latching zone (38) of the shaft into its latched position.
