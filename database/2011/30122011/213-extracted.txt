(57) Abstract : 
A communication apparatus capable of simultaneously receiving signals from a plurality of users by an SC-FDMA scheme reduces its 
circuit size. A communication apparatus BS1, BS2 is capable of simultaneously receiving signals from a plurality of users by the SC-
FDMA scheme. The communication apparatus BS1, BS2 includes a plurality of antennas la and lb; a processing unit 6 that performs 
multi-antenna signal processing on a plurality of received SC-FDMA signals in a frequency domain, the received SC-FDMA signals 
being received by the plurality of antennas la and lb; and a user separating unit 7 that demultiplexes a signal obtained through the 
multi-antenna signal processing, into signals for each user based on user allocation information in the SC-FDMA scheme.
