(57) Abstract : 
Techniques for adaptive thread scheduling on a plurality of cores for reducing system energy are described. In one embodiment, a 
thread scheduler receives leakage current information associated with the plurality of cores. The leakage current information is 
employed to schedule a thread on one of the plurality of cores to reduce system energy usage. On chip calibration of the sensors is also 
described.
