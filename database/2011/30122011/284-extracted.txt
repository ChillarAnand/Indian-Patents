(57) Abstract : 
Devices (1) have branches (20,30) for receiving AC voltages. First branches (20) comprise first light-emitting diode circuits (21) and 
first arrangements for phase-shifting first currents flowing through the first light-emitting diode circuits (21) with respect to the AC 
voltages. Second branches (30) comprise second light-emitting diode circuits (31) and do not comprise second arrangements for 
phase-shifting second currents flowing through the second light-emitting diode circuits (31) with respect to the AC voltages. As a 
result, an overall flicker index of the device (1) will be smaller than individual flicker indices of the light-emitting diode circuits 
(21,31). The first arrangements may comprise capacitors (22) coupled serially to the first light-emitting diode circuits (21). The 
branches (20,30) may further comprise resistors (23,33) coupled serially to or forming part of the light-emitting diode circuits (21,31).
