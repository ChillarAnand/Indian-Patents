(57) Abstract : 
Valve metal and valve metal oxide agglomerate powders suitable especially for the production of solid electrolytic capacitors are 
described, which, after sintering to high-porosity sintered bodies, have a high skeletal density, i.e. are low in closed pores. The 
agglomerate powders have good compactibility and an excellent sliding coefficient which depends on the specific surface area.
