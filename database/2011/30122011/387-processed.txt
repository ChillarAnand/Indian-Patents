Abstract  =>  A reinforcer (22) for installation in a structural member (20) is disclosed. The reinforcer includes a rigid carrier (24) having at least a first surface (26) and a second surface (28). The first surface (26) is substantially orthogonal to said second surface (28). Bonding material is disposed both on said first surface (26) and said second surface (28). The reinforcer (22) is configured to be installed in a structural member (20) such that the first surface (26) is substantially parallel to a longitudinal axis (L) of the structural member (20), and the second surface (28) is substantially orthogonal to the longitudinal axis (L) of the structural member (20).
