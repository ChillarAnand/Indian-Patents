(57) Abstract : 
A deposition system and process for the formation of thin film materials. In one embodiment, the process includes forming an initial 
plasma from a first material stream and allowing the plasma to evolve in space and/or time to extinguish species that are detrimental to 
the quality of the thin film material. After the initial plasma evolves to an optimum state, a second material stream is injected into the 
deposition chamber to form a composite plasma that contains a distribution of species more conducive to formation of a high quality 
thin film material. The deposition system includes a deposition chamber having a plurality of delivery points for injecting two or more 
streams (source materials or carrier gases) into a plasma region. The delivery points are staggered in space to permit an upstream 
plasma formed from a first material stream deposition source material to evolve before combining a downstream material stream with 
the plasma. Injection of different material streams is also synchronized in time. The net effect of spatial coordination and time 
synchronization of material streams is a plasma whose distribution of species is optimized for the deposition of a thin film 
photovoltaic material at high deposition rates. Delivery devices include nozzles and remote plasma sources.
