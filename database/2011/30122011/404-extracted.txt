(57) Abstract : 
The invention relates to a valve arrangement (44) for regulating the fluid pressure in an ABS brake system of a vehicle in such a way 
that, when wheels (6a, 6b) of a vehicle axle (2a) tend to lock, the brake pressure in the brake cylinders (14a, 14b) assigned to the 
wheels can be matched adaptively, in order to regulate the brake slip of the wheels (6a, 6b) to a stipulated optimal brake slip, a brake 
pressure being fed into at least one brake cylinder (14c, 14d) of at least one further axle (2b), which brake pressure is at least 
temporarily dependent on the brake slip-controlled brake pressure fed into at least one brake cylinder (14a, 14b) of the one axle (2a). 
According to the invention, the said valve arrangement has a pressure-limiting valve device (46), by means of which, when a 
stipulated brake-pressure value is overshot by the brake pressure generated for the at least one brake cylinder (14a, 14b) of the one 
axle (2a), the brake pressure for the at least one brake cylinder (14c, 14d) of the at least one further axle (2b) is limited to a brake-
pressure limit value lower than the theoretical brake-pressure value arising due to dependence on the brake pressure in the at least one 
brake cylinder (14a, 14b) of the one axle (2a).
