Abstract  =>  Liquid crystal optoelectronic devices are produced by fabricating a wafer- level component structure and affixing a plurality of discrete components to a surface structure prior to singulating the individual devices therefrom. After singulation, the individual devices include a portion of the wafer-level fabricated structure and at least of the discrete components. The wafer-level structure may include a liquid crystal and controlling electrodes, and the discrete components may include fixed lenses or image sensors. The discrete components may be located on either or both of two sides of the wafer-level structure. Multiple liquid crystal layers may be used to reduce nonuniformities in the interaction with light from different angles, and to control light of different polarizations. The liquid crystal devices may function as optoelectronic devices such as tunable lenses, shutters or diaphragms.
