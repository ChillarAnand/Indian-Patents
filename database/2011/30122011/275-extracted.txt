(57) Abstract : 
A method (400) for creating a group shared distributed reservation in a wireless network. The method comprises collecting 
information about the distributed reservation availabilities of devices in the wireless network (S410); selecting a group of shared 
devices to be included in the group shared distributed reservation based on the collected information (S420); sending a reservation 
request to each device in the group of shared devices (S430); and updating the group of shared devices to include only devices that 
accept the reservation request (S460), thereby creating a group shared distributed reservation of medium access time slots. Fig.5
