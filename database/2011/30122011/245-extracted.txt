(57) Abstract : 
Certain aspects of the present disclosure relate to a method for allocating a plurality of logical channels within each wideband channel 
specified by the IEEE 802.15.3c standard. Each logical channel can utilize the same wideband channel, but the logical channel can 
also utilize a narrowband channel (i.e., a low data rate (LDR) channel) for control and signaling. The logical channel may function as 
a common mode channel for multi-mode operations. A piconet controller (PNC) within a piconet can utilize the LDR for beaconing, 
association, and for assigning Channel Time Allocations (CTAs). Inside a CTA period, multiple devices in the piconet can 
communicate using a single-carrier mode, an OFDM mode, or some other mode.
