Abstract  =>  The invention relates to a device for testing substrates featuring magnetic elements, in particular printed products printed with magnetic printing ink. The device has a powered suction belt (2) travelling around it which transports the substrates under a measuring device (3) and is assigned to the top of at least one extractable air space (4). At least one suction fan (9) assigned to the suction belt (2) is connected to the air space (4). At least the suction belt (2) is made of non- ferromagnetic material. Each suction fan (9) assigned to the suction belt (2) takes the form of a motorless fan which is connected to a remote power source (11) via a transmission.
