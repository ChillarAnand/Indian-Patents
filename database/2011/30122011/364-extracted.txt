(57) Abstract : 
A prosthesis assembly for use with a scapula is disclosed. The prosthesis assembly includes a glenoid bearing support and a bearing. 
The glenoid bearing support includes a glenoid vault-occupying portion configured to occupy at least a portion of a glenoid vault of 
the scapula, the glenoid-vault occupying portion having a first coupling component. The glenoid bearing support further includes a 
glenoid rim replacement portion attached to the glenoid vault-occupying portion. The bearing defines a bearing surface and has a 
second coupling component configured to cooperate with the first coupling component to couple the bearing to the glenoid vault-
occupying portion. The glenoid vault-occupying portion defines a bearing-side end portion and an opposite-side end portion. The 
glenoid rim replacement portion projects outwardly from the bearing-side end portion of the glenoid vault-occupying portion. The 
glenoid bearing support defines a bone graft receptacle.
