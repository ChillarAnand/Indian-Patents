(57) Abstract : 
The buffer management system (100) is arranged to control in a data communication system an end to end delay (∆) of a data unit 
(150) from input to output. Blocks (104, 106) of data units (150, 152) are written in a buffer (102) with a block write rate (Rw), and 
data units (154, 156) are read from this buffer (102) with a read rate (Rr). The end to end delay (∆) is controlled by adapting the read 
rate (Rr) from the buffer (102), and hence the buffer filling (F) on the basis of measurements of delays in the buffer management 
system (100). For the calculation of the read rate (Rr) at least an input time measurement (mTa) of an input time instant (Ta) of input 
of the data unit (150) in the buffer management system (100) is required
