Abstract  =>  The invention comprises a novel apparatus for delivering a nutritive substance comprising a container body having a base at one end thereof, an upper portion adapted for removable receipt of a closure, the upper portion defining an opening therein, and a chamber defined by the container body, the chamber being in fluid communication with the upper portion opening. A seal is bonded across the upper portion opening of the container and is adapted to provide an airtight seal across the opening. A closure is removably coupled to the container upper portion. A nutritive substance is coated onto an element selected from the group consisting of an inner surface of the container upper portion, the closure, an insert positioned above the seal, and combinations thereof. The seal prevents contact between the nutritive substance and the contents of the container until the seal is removed or pierced.
