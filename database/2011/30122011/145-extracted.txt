(57) Abstract : 
An IPA-ECU (410) recognizes the position of a power transmitting unit by image recognition, based on image information from a 
camera (120) mounted on a vehicle. The IPA-ECU (410) then performs guidance control, according to the result of the image 
recognition, so as to guide the vehicle to the power transmitting unit (first guidance control). A resonance ECU (460) estimates the 
distance between the power transmitting unit and a power receiving unit according to a status of feeding from the power transmitting 
unit to the power receiving unit. When the power transmitting unit reaches a position below the vehicle body, an HV-ECU (470) 
performs, according to the distance information from the resonance ECU (460), guidance control so that the vehicle performs an 
alignment between the power transmitting unit and the power receiving unit (second guidance control).
