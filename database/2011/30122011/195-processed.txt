Abstract  =>  The invention relates to a method for determining the spectral and spatial distribution of a braking photon flow along at least one direction in space (x, y, z), characterised in that the method comprises measuring the neutrons resulting from the impact of the braking photons (ph) on at least one conversion target (5) which is moved in the direction (x, y, z) in space. The invention can be used for X- rays, medical imaging, tomography, etc.
