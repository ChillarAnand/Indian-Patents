(57) Abstract : 
A resistance based memory circuit is disclosed. The circuit includes a first transistor load of a data cell and a bit line adapted to detect 
a first logic state. The bit line is coupled to the first transistor load and coupled to a data cell having a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) 
structure. The bit line is adapted to detect data having a logic one value when the bit line has a first voltage value, and to detect data 
having a logic zero value when the bit line has a second voltage value. The circuit further includes a second transistor load of a 
reference cell. The second transistor load is coupled to the first transistor load, and the second transistor load has an associated 
reference voltage value. A characteristic of the first transistor load, such as transistor width, is adjustable to modify the first voltage 
value and the second voltage value without substantially changing the reference voltage value.
