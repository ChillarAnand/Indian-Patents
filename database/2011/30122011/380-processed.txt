Abstract  =>  In an apparatus on a flat card or roller card for setting the working spacing between the clothed cylinder and at least one clothed neighbouring roller, for example doffer and/or licker-in, which co-operate with one another with a small spacing between their cylindrical surfaces (working spacing) at the fibre transfer points and in which the working spacing can be reset to a pre-determined value as a result of changes in dimensions caused by thermal expansion and/or centrifugal forces, an adjustment device operable by supplying thermal energy is provided for the neighbouring roller. In order to enable the setting of a pre-determined spacing between neighbouring rollers to be effected in a simple way and within a short space of time in the event of changes in the dimensions of the rollers, there is provided a device for actively supplying and/or dissipating thermal energy which is associated with the adjustment device, wherein in the event of a change in the dimensions of the rollers the working spacing between the cylinder and at least one neighbouring roller can be set or reset.
