Abstract  =>  A side stand position detecting device that can prevent generation of a variation in detection result caused by a variation in magnetic force. A side stand position detecting device includes a magnet, a hall IC that is disposed opposite the magnet, and a magnetic shielding plate that turns in association with a turning operation of a side stand. The magnetic shielding plate includes a projection. The projection of the magnetic shielding plate is located in a predetermined region between the magnet and the hall IC when the side stand is located in a standing position, and the projection retreats from the predetermined region when the side stand is located in a storage position.
