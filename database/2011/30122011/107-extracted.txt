(57) Abstract : 
A device (10) for x-ray material testing of test objects (15) includes a translational conveyor device (14) for automatically serially 
feeding and discharging test objects (15) to or from a testing position and an x-ray device (20) comprising an x-ray source (12) for 
irradiating a test object (15) held in the testing position on a carrier (33) and an x-ray detector (13), wherein the test object (15) and the 
x-ray device (20) can be rotated relative to each other around an essentially vertical rotational axis R, only, during x-ray testing. 
According to one aspect of the invention, the carrier (33) together with the test object (15) held thereon can be rotated as a whole 
around the rotational axis R for the x-ray testing. According to a further aspect of the invention, the x-ray device (20) can be rotated as 
a whole around the rotational axis R for the x-ray testing. The carrier (33) is a translational conveyor device for the test object.
