Abstract  =>  A method of fabricating a semiconductor using a fin field effect transistor (FINFET) is disclosed. In a particular embodiment, a method includes depositing, on a silicon substrate, a first dummy structure having a first sidewall and a second sidewall separated by a first width. The method also includes depositing, on the silicon substrate, a second dummy structure concurrently with depositing the first dummy structure. The second dummy structure has a third sidewall and a fourth sidewall that are separated by a second width. The second width is substantially greater than the first width. The first dummy structure is used to form a first pair of fins separated by approximately the first width. The second dummy structure is used to form a second pair of fins separated by approximately the second width.
