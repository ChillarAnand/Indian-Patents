Abstract  =>  A metal loaded catalyst comprises a support and main active metal components and optional auxiliary active metal components, wherein the main active metal components are elementary substances and obtained by ionizing radiation reducing precursors of main active metal components. The catalyst can be widely used in the catalytic reactions of petrochemistry industry with high activity and selectivity. The catalyst can be used directly without being reduced preliminarily by hydrogen.
