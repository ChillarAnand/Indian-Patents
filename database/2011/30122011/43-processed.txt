Abstract  =>  The invention provides an actinically-crosslinkable linear polysiloxane copolymer. The actinically-crosslinkable polysiloxane copolymer can be used to prepare a silicone hdyrogel contact lens having a hydrophilic surface without post-curing surface treatment. The invention is also related to a silicone hydrogel contact lens obtained from a lens-forming material including an actinically- crosslinkable polysiloxane copolymer of the invention and to a method for making an actinically-crosslinkable polysiloxane copolymer of the invention. In addition, the invention provides a non-crosslinkable linear polysiloxane copolymer capable of being used as a internal wetting agent which can render the surface of a silicone hydrogel contact lens hydrophilic.
