A method of receiving streaming music at a wireless device is provided. The method includes receiving a music stream from a server, 
emitting music from the music stream, and playing a locally stored song, when a network interruption is detected. The method may 
further include accessing a playlist and determining whether the playlist includes at least one of a user favorite song, a same artist 
song, or a same genre song. Moreover, the method may also include determining that a network connection is re-established, finishing 
playback of the locally stored song, receiving another music stream from the server, and emitting music from the other music stream.
