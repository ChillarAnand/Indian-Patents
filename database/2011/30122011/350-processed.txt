Abstract  =>  The present invention relates to an optical element for a light emitting device, wherein the optical element comprises a sintered ceramic body comprising a wavelength converting layer and a scattering layer, and to a method of manufacturing thereof. More specifically, the invention relates to an optical element, comprising a sintered ceramic body of a first layer and a second layer arranged on the first layer, wherein the first layer comprises a wavelength converting material, the porosity of the second layer is higher than the porosity of the first layer, and pores in the second layer are arranged to provide scattering of a light beam. The method for manufacturing of the optical element comprises providing a green body comprising a first layer of a first material and a second layer of a second material; and co-sintering said layers into a sintered ceramic body; Fig. 1
