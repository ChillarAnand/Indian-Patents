Abstract  =>  The husk of linseed stems is a waste product generated after the linseed fibres have been removed by scutching process. It is an agricultural waste which has no use. Value addition to the waste product by using it as filler in HDPE up to a loading of 50% is the objective of the research work. When no compatibilizer is used 10% loading of husk causes sharp decrease in the strength properties. There is however no further decline in the properties up to a loading of 50%. Only water absorption increases with increasing filler content. To improve the properties a compatibilizer has been added. Further the husk has been chemically treated to make it more compatible with the plastics. The waste bio-fibre filled HDPE has been converted into finished products that can be used for several applications such as partition walls, boards, trays etc. thereby adding value to the waste bio-fibres.
