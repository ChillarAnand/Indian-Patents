(57) Abstract : 
A method of processing an image signal comprising image and depth information is provided. The method is configured to perform 
segmentation on an image based on depth/disparity information present in the image signal comprising said image, and subsequently 
inpaint background for correction of the errors in the image around the foreground objects into a region that extends beyond the 
segment boundary of the foreground object and/or inpaint foreground for correction of errors in the image into a region that extends 
inside the segment boundary of the foreground object. In this way compression and other artifacts may be reduced. Fig. 2
