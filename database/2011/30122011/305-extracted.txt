(57) Abstract : 
Systems and methodologies are described that facilitate avoidance of duplicative resource allocation and/or erroneous service charges 
via unambiguously indicating an entity responsible for quality of service (QoS) initiation. In one example, an indication is provided to 
a mobile device to indicate a preference for network-initiated QoS or a preference for device -initiated QoS. QoS for a data flow can 
be established in accordance with the indication. For instance, the mobile device initiates QoS when the indication specifies a 
preference for device-initiated QoS while a network establishes QoS when the indication specifies a preference for network-initiated 
QoS.
