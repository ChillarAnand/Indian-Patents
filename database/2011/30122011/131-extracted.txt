(57) Abstract : 
Apparatus and methods for determining a connection quality of a wireless device with a wireless communications network comprise a 
user manager operable to receive a plurality of communications messages as recorded by the wireless device, where the plurality of 
communications messages comprise messages transmitted from and received by the wireless device via the wireless communication 
network. Further, a connection quality module associated with the user manager is operable to generate a connection quality record 
comprising a connection quality characteristic based on a detection of a predetermined sequence of communications messages within 
the plurality of communications messages. Optionally, an optimization module may generate a configuration change for the wireless 
device and/or a network component based on the connection quality characteristic.
