Abstract  =>  A structural member assembly includes a substantially hollow structural member (10) and a structural reinforcer (20). The hollow structural member (10) is formed by a plurality of panels (12, 14). At least one of the panels (12) includes a cutout region (18) extending from the edge of the panel (12) to the interior of the panel (12) so that the cut-out region (18) is not fully enclosed by the panel (12). The structural reinforcer (20) includes a rigid carrier (21) and a bonding material (22). The structural reinforcer (20) is installed in the interior of the structural member (10) across said cut-out region (18).
