(57) Abstract : 
Novel enzymes that stereoselectively reduce imine derivatives were isolated and purified, and polynucleotides encoding the enzymes 
were cloned. Optically active amine derivatives were produced by acting on imine derivatives with a culture of microorganisms 
having the ability to stereoselectively reduce the compounds, microbial cells or processed products thereof, and/or imine reductases 
thereof, followed by collecting the generated optically active amine derivatives. The present invention enables, for example, 
production of an optically active compound represented by formula (IV): formula (IV): (wherein R group represents an alkyl group 
having one to three carbon atoms; and n represents an integer of 1 to 4).
