Abstract  =>  A method and apparatus for removing contaminants from at least one portion of a semiconductor mold are disclosed. A nozzle is positioned at a preset position with respect to the portion of the semiconductor mold. Solid particles of a material that sublimes instantaneously along with at least one of the abrasives and additives are blasted at a predefined temperature and/or pressure over the portion, through the nozzle. On impact, the particles remove the contaminants from the portion of the semiconductor mold.
