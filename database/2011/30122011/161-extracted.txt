(57) Abstract : 
The present invention provides a floating dock comprising a submersible platform (11) comprising at least one buoyancy tank (17) 
wherein the buoyancy tank has a plurality of compartments (19) each of which has a permanently open vent (23) through which water 
is freely flowable into and out of the compartment and an inlet (21) which enables air to be expelled from the compartment into the 
atmosphere or enables compressed air to be supplied to the compartment (19) via a non return valve (B) which causes water within the 
tank to be forced out via the vent, thereby increasing the buoyancy of the tank. The vent does not have any valves associated with it 
and is permanently open to the sea. As a result the floating dry dock of the present invention may be lowered and raised faster than 
conventional dry docks which rely on valved vents to control entry and exit of water into and out of their buoyancy tanks.
