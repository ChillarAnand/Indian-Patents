Abstract  =>  Acetyl anhydrides such as acetyl sulfate are produced by a process for comprising contacting methane and carbon dioxide in an anhydrous environment in the presence of effective amounts of a transition metal catalyst and a reaction promoter, and an acid anhydride compound, and optionally an acid. The acetyl anhydride can be contacted with water to produce acetic acid or with an alcohol to produce a product comprising an acetate ester and that may also comprise acetic acid. Optionally, water in stoichiometric amounts or less, with respect to the acetic anhydride, may be fed to a continuous process of this type to produce some acetic acid in situ.
