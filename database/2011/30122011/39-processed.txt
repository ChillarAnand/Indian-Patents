Abstract  =>  A diaphragm failure monitoring system for detecting leakage in a diaphragm of a diaphragm pump. The system includes a pump having an operating chamber containing a working fluid and a pumping chamber for pumping material into and out of the pump and a diaphragm separating the operating and pumping chambers. A first optic fiber is joined to the operating chamber for transmitting an optic signal across the working fluid. A second optic fiber is joined to the operating chamber for receiving the optic signal from the first optic fiber. An electric signal establishing device establishes a first electrical signal when the optic signal from the first optic fiber to the second optic fiber passes through uncontarninated working fluid. The electric signal establishing device establishes a second electrical signal when the optic signal from the first optic fiber to the second optic fiber passes through contaminated working fluid, whereby leakage of a contaminating material through the diaphragm into the operating chamber can be detected when the second electrical signal is established.
