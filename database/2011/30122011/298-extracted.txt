To perform zone-based workload scheduling according to environmental conditions in a system having electronic devices, indicators 
of cooling efficiencies of the electronic devices in corresponding zones are aggregated (206, 406, 510) to form aggregated indicators 
for respective zones, where the zones include respective subsets of electronic devices. Workload is assigned (208, 408) to the 
electronic devices according to the aggregated indicators. [FIG. 2]
