(57) Abstract : 
A method of fabricating a semiconductor using a fin field effect transistor (FINFET) is disclosed. In a particular embodiment, a 
method includes depositing, on a silicon substrate, a first dummy structure having a first sidewall and a second sidewall separated by a 
first width. The method also includes depositing, on the silicon substrate, a second dummy structure concurrently with depositing the 
first dummy structure. The second dummy structure has a third sidewall and a fourth sidewall that are separated by a second width. 
The second width is substantially greater than the first width. The first dummy structure is used to form a first pair of fins separated by 
approximately the first width. The second dummy structure is used to form a second pair of fins separated by approximately the 
second width.
