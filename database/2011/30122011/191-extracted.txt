Disclosed is a simple and inexpensive handwritten input/output system that allows text and/or diagrams to be input by hand. A simple 
and inexpensive handwritten input/output system in which an image pickup means picks up and transmits an image of a medium 
provided with a writing region, using a dot pattern to define coordinate information/code information, the image data of this dot 
pattern is stored by a dot pattern analysis means, and locus information is found by code analysis; a locus identification means 
identifies the locus information of the text or diagrams that are traced in the writing region, based on changes in the coordinate 
information obtained by analysis; text and/or diagrams etc. can be input by handwriting by transmitting the locus information to an 
information processing means, together with processing instructions based on the identification information obtained by a processing 
instruction means. Also, a handwritten input system is provided wherein not only text or diagram information but also associated 
information can be input together.
