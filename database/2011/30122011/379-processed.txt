Abstract  =>  A ballast water treatment system is provided that can kill microorganisms and bacteria or the like included in magnetic flocs so as to eliminate an impact on the environment and human bodies. The ballast water treatment system includes a coagulation section for agitating magnetic powder and coagulant added to ballast water to generate magnetic flocs; and a magnetic separation section for collecting the magnetic flocs generated by the coagulation section. The ballast water treatment system is characterized in having a pipe path to which the magnetic flocs are taken and a heating section for heating the pipe path. The heating section may be provided as a tank and the pipe path may be immersed in the tank.
