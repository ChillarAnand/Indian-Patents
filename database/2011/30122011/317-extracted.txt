A process for producing high-purity cis-4-fluoro -L-proline derivatives highly safely under milder conditions in high yield, 
characterized by reacting a trans-4-hydroxy -L-proline derivative represented by the general formula [I]: (wherein R1 is an Î±-amino-
protecting group; and R2 a carboxyl-protecting group) with N,N-diethyl-N-(1,1,2,3,3,3-hexafluoropropyl)amine in the presence of a 
hydrogen fluoride scavenger.
