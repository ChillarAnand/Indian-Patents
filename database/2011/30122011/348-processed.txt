Abstract  =>  Provided is a more efficient manner of transmitting a control message to reach into a neighboring sector (e.g., inter-sector) of a wireless network environment. The control message can be utilized for purposes such as handoff, indicating an amount of interference, inter-sector power control for managing inter-sector interference, sector loading, or other control messages. The control message can be placed on a set of resources utilizing planned reuse and/or statistical reuse. Statistical reuse includes selecting a subcarrier set for carrying the control message. According to some aspects, the control message can be sent over a backhaul channel.
