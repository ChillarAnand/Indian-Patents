(57) Abstract : 
A NOx removal catalyst for high-temperature flue gas according to the present invention is a NOx removal catalyst for high-
temperature flue gas that contains nitrogen oxide in which tungsten oxide with the number of molecular layers of tungsten oxide 
(WO3) being five or less is supported on a complex oxide carrier containing titanium oxide. Even when high-temperature denitration 
is continued,, a bonding force with a carrier of WO3 can be properly maintained and volatilization can be suppressed while 
maintaining a high NOx removal performance. For example, the NOx removal catalyst is particularly suitable for reducing and 
removing nitrogen oxide contained in high- temperature gas discharged from a thermal power plant and a high-temperature boiler.
