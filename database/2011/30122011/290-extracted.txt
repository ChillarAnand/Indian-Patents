(57) Abstract : 
Embodiments herein disclose a digitally precoded SC-FDMA scheme with low PAPR, where the scheme applies a constellation 
rotation to the M-ary input data sequence, before circularly convolving the rotated data sequence with a polynomial decoder. The data 
is then transformed to the frequency domain and then mapped. An N-point IIFT is then applied to the data to produce time domain 
samples.
