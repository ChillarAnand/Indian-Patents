Abstract  =>  A pressure sensor (56) includes a fill tube (93) which is arranged to couple to a process pressure. A sensor (98) is coupled to the fill tube (93) and is configured to measure pressure of fluid in the fill tube (93) as a function of a change of a physical property of the fill tube (93). Circuitry (74) is provided to measure pressure based upon the change of the physical property of the fill tube (93).
