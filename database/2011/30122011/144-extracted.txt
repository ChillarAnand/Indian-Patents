(57) Abstract : 
The subject of the invention is a valve for universal utilization and several purposes allowing by its formation the relatively high flow 
in the basic state and slightly open state of the valve even in case of small pressure differences in case of low pressure; furthermore the 
formation of the valve allows to ensure providing functions depending on the direction of flow that in given case can be regulated 
regarding back-pressure, partial back-pressure, pressure relief, partial relief limiting functions. The valve according to the invention is 
made in one piece from a soft, flexible material, and it has a full cross-sectional open basic part (2) at one end, and an intermediate 
part (3) of decreasing cross-section joining the said basic part (2), as well as a flattened part (4) joining the intermediate part (3) in the 
other end of the valve (1). It is characterized by that, the flattened part (4) is a structure sintered or pressed or glued in the material of 
the valve (1), and on the flattened part (4) of the valve (1) a pressed rim (7) made by airtight fixing of the edges of the flattened part 
(4), preferably by sintering, or pressing or glueing is formed, furthermore the length (L) of the intermediate part (3) is L = 0,5...6 (K/ 
π), compared to perimeter (K) in the basic part of the valve (1), in connection with the medium in motion, and the length (N) of the 
pressed rim (7) in the basic part of the valve (1) compared to perimeter (K) in connection with the medium in motion is N = 0,1...2 (K/ 
π).
