(57) Abstract : 
An intake manifold which is made of resin and configured to be connected to an intake port of a cylinder of an internal combustion 
engine, includes: an EGR inlet for discharging exhaust recirculation gas toward a cylinder side; and a tumble control valve which is 
switchable between an open position in which an intake line to the cylinder is opened and a close position in which the intake line is 
closed, and has an indentation that forms a gap between the tumble control valve and an inner wall of the intake line when the tumble 
control valve is in the close position. The intake manifold is configured so that, when the intake manifold is assembled to the internal 
combustion engine, in the open position and in the close position of the tumble control valve, any perpendicular line extending 
downward from the EGR inlet does not intersect the tumble control valve, and at the same time, in at least one of the open position 
and the close position of the tumble control valve, a perpendicular line extending downward from a most upstream portion of the EGR 
inlet in an intake direction intersects an area of the indentation.
