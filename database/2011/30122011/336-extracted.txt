(57) Abstract : 
A non-leaching adhesive system and its use in a liquid immersion objective for immersion-writing of masters for optical discs are 
disclosed. The adhesive system comprises at least one monomer, selected from among the group of acrylate and methacrylate 
monomers, allylic monomers, norbornene monomers, hybrid monomers thereof, containing chemically different polymerizable 
groups, and multifunctional thiol monomers, provided that said thiol is used in combination with at least one of said non-thiol 
monomers; and a polymerization initiator. At least one of said monomers, not being a thiol, is provided with at least two functional 
polymerizable groups to obtain a crosslinked polymer network. The polymerization initiator is preferably an initiator that can be 
activated both thermally and with UV radiation. The adhesive system may further contain a reactive diluent. Further the use of the 
present adhesive system in mounting a liquid immersion objective is disclosed.
