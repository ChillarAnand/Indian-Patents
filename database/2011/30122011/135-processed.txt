Abstract  =>  The present invention pertains to a process for producing sodium chloride comprising the steps of: (i) preparing a brine having a sodium chloride concentration which is higher than the sodium chloride concentration of the eutectic point but lower than the sodium chloride concentration of a saturated brine by dissolving a sodium chloride source in water; (ii) cooling the resulting brine by indirect cooling in a self-cleaning fluidized bed heat exchanger/crystallizer to a temperature lower than 00C but higher than the eutectic temperature of the resulting brine, thereby forming a slurry comprising sodium chloride dihydrate and a mother liquor; (iii) feeding the sodium chloride dihydrate to a recrystallizer to form sodium chloride and a mother liquor, and (iv) recycling at least part of the mother liquor obtained in step (ii) and/or step (iii) to step (i).
