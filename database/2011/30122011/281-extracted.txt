(57) Abstract : 
A method of generating an image collection is described. A plurality of images are retrieved (step 202) and the images are divided into 
clusters according to a predetermined characteristic of the content of the images (step 204). At least one of the clusters is selected 
based on a number of images in each cluster (step 206). For each selected cluster, at least one image is selected on the basis of a 
predetermined criterion (step 208) and an image collection comprising the selected images is generated (step 210). Fig. 2
