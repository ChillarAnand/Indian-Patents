(57) Abstract : 
A valve operating device for a vehicle engine includes a camshaft seat fixed in a cylinder head, a camshaft assembly arranged passing 
through the camshaft seat, at least one bolt passing through the cylinder head and the camshaft seat, a rocker-arm mechanism 
including at least one rocker arm shaft, and a cover plate. The cover plate includes a fixing section and a baffling section, wherein the 
fixing section touches and is secured on a top surface of the camshaft seat, and the bolt passes through the cover plate. The baffling 
section bends from the fixing section and extends over an edge of the front seat hole so as to restrict the axial displacement amount of 
the camshaft assembly. The baffling section can correspond both to the axially-baffling surface and the rotationally-baffling surface of 
the rocker arm shaft so as to restrict axial displacement amount and rotation amount of the rocker arm shaft. Thereby, there is no need 
for the camshaft seat to be drilled and tapped, laterally, for bolt fastening, so that cost can be lowered and engine minimization is 
enhanced.
