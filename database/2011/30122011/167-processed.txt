Abstract  =>  A pressure sensor (56) includes a sensor body (93) which is arranged to couple to a process pressure. The sensor body (93) has a magnetic property which changes as a function of pressure applied by a process fluid. A sensor (98) is coupled to the sensor body (93) and is configured to measure pressure of fluid in the sensor body (93) as a function of a change of magnetic property of the sensor body (93).
