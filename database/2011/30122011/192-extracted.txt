(57) Abstract : 
The present invention relates to a multiple-junction photoelectric device (1) comprising a substrate (2) on which a first conducting 
layer (3) is deposited, at least two elementary photoelectric devices (4, 6) of p-i-n or p-n configuration, on which a second conducting 
layer (7) is deposited, and at least one intermediate layer (5) provided between two adjacent elementary photoelectric devices (4, 6). 
According to the invention the intermediate layer (5) has, on the incoming light side, a top face (10) and, on the other side, a bottom 
face (11), said top (10) and bottom (11) faces having respectively a surface morphology comprising inclined elementary surfaces such 
that α90bottom is smaller than α90top by at least 3°, preferably 6°, more preferably 10°, and even more preferably 15°; where α90top 
is the angle for which 90% of the elementary surfaces of the top face (10) of the intermediate layer (5) have an inclination equal to or 
less than this angle, and α90bottom is the angle for which 90% of the elementary surfaces of the bottom face (11) of the intermediate 
layer (5) have an inclination equal to or less than this angle.
