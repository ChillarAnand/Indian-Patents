(57) Abstract : 
A method for preventing overhearing of private conversations in public spaces is disclosed. The method comprises detecting the social 
activity of the people in the public space and assessing the social situation and adapting the degree of sound masking and/or sound 
absorption at the desired locations to suit the assessed social situation. The method can be useful in public environments such as 
airports, city centers, club, bars, cafes and shopping centers where it is required to prevent overhearing of private conversations.
