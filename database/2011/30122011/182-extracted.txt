(57) Abstract : 
Apparatuses and methods for managing transmission protocols for group communications are disclosed. In an example, an access 
network receives a forward link packet having a first transmission protocol, the forward link packet associated with a given group 
communication session. The access network determines whether the first transmission protocol is acceptable. The access network 
selects a second transmission protocol, if the determining step determines the first transmission protocol is not acceptable. The access 
network transmits the forward link packet in accordance with the second transmission protocol (e.g., by mapping the packet between 
transmission protocols at the access network).
