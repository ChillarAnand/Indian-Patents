(57) Abstract : 
A method (300) for discovering a route between a source node and a destination node in mesh wireless media (WiMedia) based 
networks. The method comprises upon receiving a route request (RREQ) by an intermediate node between the source node and the 
destination node, saving, in the RREQ, at least the identification (ID) number of the intermediate node and a transmission channel rate 
of a link on which the RREQ is received on(S320); computing a new route price (S330); determining if the new route price is larger 
than a price included in the received RREQ (S340); updating the received RREQ to include the new route price when the new route 
price is larger than the route price in the received RREQ (S350); and forwarding the updated RREQ to one or more neighbors of the 
intermediate node (S370). Fig. 3
