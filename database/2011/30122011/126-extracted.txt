(57) Abstract : 
Techniques for performing location logging and location and time based filtering are described. In one design of location logging, a 
terminal periodically determines its location, e.g., during its paging slots. The terminal determines whether there is a change in its 
location and stores its location if a change in location is detected. In one design of location and time based filtering, the terminal 
obtains a location and time criterion with a target area and a time period. The terminal determines its location during the time period, 
e.g., based on the location log. The terminal evaluates the location and time criterion based on the target area and its location during 
the time period, e.g., based on at least one sector ID for the target area and one or more sector IDs for its location. The terminal 
determines whether to download and/or present broadcast information based on the result of the evaluation.
