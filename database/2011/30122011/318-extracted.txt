(57) Abstract : 
The invention relates to 2-substituted pyrimidines of formula (I), in which the index n and the substituents R1, R2 and R3 are defined 
as cited in the description. R4 is defined as follows: R4 corresponds to one of the formulae (II), in which X represents a direct bond, -
(C=0)-, -(C=0)-NH-, -(C=0)-0-, -0-, -NRc-, whereby the respective molecule on the left is bonded to the nitrogen atom; Ra represents 
hydrogen, methyl, benzyl, trifluoromethyl, allyl, propargyl or methoxymethyl; Rb represents hydrogen, C1-C6 alkyl, C2-C6 alkynyl; 
Rc represents hydrogen, methyl or C1-C4 acyl; and Z represents S or NRb. The aliphatic groups of the radical definitions of Ra, Rb 
and/or Rc can in turn carry one or two groups Rw, whereby Rw represents halogen, ORx, NHRx, C1-C6 alkyl, C1-C4 alkoxycarbonyl, 
C1-C4 acylamino, [1,3]dioxolane-C1-C4 alkyl, [1,3]dioxane-C1-C4 alkyl and Rx represents hydrogen, methyl, allyl or propargyl. The 
invention also relates to a method for producing said compounds, to agents containing said compounds and to the use of the latter as 
pesticides.
