(57) Abstract : 
The invention relates to a process for fabricating an electrolyte insulator semiconductor device having more than one step reservoir by 
adapting a multiple exposure lithographic technique, the process comprising the steps of-providing a substrate and depositing and 
photolithographically patering a dielectric material which acts as a mask, the depositing of the photoresist material initially made to 
both the surfaces of the substrate, the first surface after oxidization retained as an oxidized surface weile the second surface being 
made free of oxidized material through removal of the deposits; applying a photoresist on the oxidized surface of the substrate; 
creating an inner opening to generate a single step reservoir by fully exposing the photoresist surface according to a first pattern; 
creating an outer opening to generate a two step reservoir by partially exposing the photoresist corresponding a second pattern; and 
configuring the contacts adapting a first metal on the back side, and a second metal on the shoulder of an upper step by metal 
evaporation through the mask. {FIGURE 1}
