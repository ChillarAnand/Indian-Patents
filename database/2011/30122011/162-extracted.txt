(57) Abstract : 
Image processing methods and systems are disclosed. In a particular embodiment, a method is disclosed that includes receiving image 
data. The image data includes color component data representing a location of a pixel in a color space. The method further includes 
performing a linear transformation of the location of the pixel in the color space when the location is identified as within a skin color 
region of the color space. The linear transformation is performed by mapping the location of the pixel at a first portion of the skin 
color region to a second portion of the skin color region based on a position of the pixel within the skin color region and based on the 
proximity of the position of the pixel to a boundary of the skin color region. The color space remains substantially continuous at the 
boundary of the skin color region after applying the linear transformation.
