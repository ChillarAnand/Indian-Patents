(57) Abstract : 
A data communications system includes a plurality of different networks coupled together by communication links, and further 
includes at least one multicast agent for coupling a multicast message transmission from a first network to a second network. The 
multicast agent operates to modify the multicast message transmission from a multicast protocol of the first network to a multicast 
protocol of the second network. The first network may be an IP network, such as a wireless IP network, and the second network may 
be a non-IP network, such as WLAN or a Bluetooth network. There may be at least one mobile host coupled to the second network for 
receiving the multicast message transmission from the multicast agent. There may be multiple intermediate networks coupled between 
a multicast message server and receiving mobile devices.
