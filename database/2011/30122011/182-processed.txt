Abstract  =>  Apparatuses and methods for managing transmission protocols for group communications are disclosed. In an example, an access network receives a forward link packet having a first transmission protocol, the forward link packet associated with a given group communication session. The access network determines whether the first transmission protocol is acceptable. The access network selects a second transmission protocol, if the determining step determines the first transmission protocol is not acceptable. The access network transmits the forward link packet in accordance with the second transmission protocol (e.g., by mapping the packet between transmission protocols at the access network).
