(57) Abstract : 
The present invention relates generally to the field of molecular biology and concerns a method for improving various economically 
important growth characteristics in plants. More specifically, the present invention concerns inter alia a method for modifying growth 
characteristics in plants by modulating expression in a plant of a nucleic acid encoding a HUB1 (Histone Monoubiquitination 1) 
polypeptide or encoding another protein useful in the methods of the present invention. The modified growth characteristics comprise 
a modification of light regulated phenotypes, such as modified circadian clock and/or circadian clock responses, or modified plant 
architecture.
