(57) Abstract : 
In a device for treating sheet-like substrates with light provision is made for a suction table (5) which is provided with a circulating 
suction strip (4) for transporting the sheet-like substrates, which suction strip forms a descending loop (10) relative to its table-parallel 
transport level (a), such loop comprising a descending branch (11) and, adjacent to the latter, an ascending branch (12), with a gap for 
the passage of light between the descending branch (11) and the ascending branch (12) of the suction strip (4) being bridged by a 
stationary bridging member (14) which at least partially allows light to pass through it and whose surface (b) is disposed at a level 
slightly recessed relative to the parallel transport level (a). Thus, a high degree of accuracy and trouble-free operation are ensured even 
at high transport speeds.
