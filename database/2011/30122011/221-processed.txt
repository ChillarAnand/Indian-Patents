Abstract  =>  This innovation relates to systems and methods for transmission of protocol data units, and more particularly to processing polling requests from a radio link control peer. A radio link control transmitter can poll a receiver to obtain a report regarding the status of a set of data packets, and the polls can be sent in-band with a data packet. The receiver can determine to wait before sending the status report based on one or more characteristics of the received data packets.
