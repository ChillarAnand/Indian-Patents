Abstract  =>  A method of creating a three-dimensional image signal comprises receiving a first image component, receiving a second component for creating a three-dimensional image in combination with the first image component, receiving a text component for including in the three-dimensional image, receiving a data component comprising location information describing the location of the text component within the three-dimensional image, and creating a three-dimensional image signal comprising the first image component, the second component, the text component, and the data component. The signal is rendered by rendering a three-dimensional image from the first image component and the second component, the rendering including rendering the text component in the three-dimensional image, the rendering of the text component including adjusting three-dimensional parameters of the three-dimensional image in the location of the rendered text component.
