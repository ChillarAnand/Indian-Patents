(57) Abstract : 
A system and method for self cleaning an air idler are provided. An air idler non-contactingly guides printable media using a flow of 
fluid through a porous surface portion. Rotation of the air idler results in rubbing contact with one or more wipers, during which debris 
is removed from the porous surface portion. A cleaning solution is used to remove ink and/or paper residue from the porous surface 
portion. The cleaning solution can wet one or more of the wipers. The cleaning solution can circulate through a reservoir disposed in 
contact with a portion of the air idler. [FIG. 1]
