Abstract  =>  A solid fuel powder combustion system and a method thereof are revealed. By means of a hermetic helical feeder that prevents high pressure combustion gas from leaking along the combustor to a shaft of a helical fan inside a closed housing, solid fuel powder is fed into an open cycle gas turbine system for combustion. Then combustion gas generated by combustion enters a gas turbine and expands to do work and generate power.
