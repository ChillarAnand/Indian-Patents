(57) Abstract : 
Construction of a valve-member monitoring system using wireless communication is facilitated. The valve-member monitoring 
system is structured with operating-condition sensors each attached to each of multiple steam traps installed on a manifold. The 
manifold serves as a discharged condensate collecting pipe in which condensate is discharged through the multiple steam traps. The 
valve-member monitoring system further includes a sensor controlling terminal cevice that is attached to the manifold or in the 
vicinity of the manifold and exchanges information by radio with a central control apparatus. In the valve-member monitoring system, 
the terminal device is connected to the operating-condition sensors each attached to each of the steam traps installed on the manifold 
with lead 1 ines This reduces time and effort required to determine which operating-condition sensors are to be connected to the 
terminal device, and therefore facilitates the construction of the valve-member monitoring system, which are excellent results.
