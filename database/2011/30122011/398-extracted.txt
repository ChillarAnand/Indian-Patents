(57) Abstract : 
A toilet has a vacuum source (42) that applies a vacuum to a trapway (14) at the beginning of a flushing to immediately flush the toilet 
bowl (12). As a result, water from the water tunnel 26 and the toilet bowl top channel 28 flow into the bowl after the flushing to create 
a large water spot (98) in the toilet bowl. A low water flush (e.g. 1 Â½ liters to flush urine) can be obtained by not letting water flow out 
of a secondary volume (61) that lies outside a divider (140) in an isolator (40).
