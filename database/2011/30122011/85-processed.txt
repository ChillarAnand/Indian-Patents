Abstract  =>  Novel enzymes that stereoselectively reduce imine derivatives were isolated and purified, and polynucleotides encoding the enzymes were cloned. Optically active amine derivatives were produced by acting on imine derivatives with a culture of microorganisms having the ability to stereoselectively reduce the compounds, microbial cells or processed products thereof, and/or imine reductases thereof, followed by collecting the generated optically active amine derivatives. The present invention enables, for example, production of an optically active compound represented by formula (IV): formula (IV): (wherein R group represents an alkyl group having one to three carbon atoms; and n represents an integer of 1 to 4).
