(57) Abstract : 
The present invention relates to an angle adjuster for a bicycle saddle that is disposed between a frame of a vehicle and a saddle. The 
angle adjuster for a bicycle saddle includes: a frame connector connected to the frame; a saddle connector rotatably connected to the 
upper end of the frame connector and supporting the saddle; an angle adjusting assembly including a main clutch fixing and releasing 
the frame connector and the saddle connector, and controlling rotational angle of the saddle connector with respect to the frame 
connector by the release operation of the main clutch; an operating lever mounted on the frame to operate the main clutch; and a wire 
connecting the main clutch with the operating lever and operating the main clutch, when the operating lever is operated. Therefore, the 
angle adjuster for a bicycle saddle according to the present invention makes it possible to adjust angle of the saddle to fit the body 
shapes of users such that they can ride the bicycle in a comfortable position. Further, it is possible to prevent an accident by 
appropriately adjusting angle of the saddle such that the userâ€™s body does not inclined in one direction, when going up or coming 
down a slope. In particular, it is possible for the users to freely adjust the angle and height of the saddle by operating the operating 
lever while the bicycle runs, thereby providing the users with convenience.
