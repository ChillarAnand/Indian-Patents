(57) Abstract : 
A hydraulic control system for a dual clutch transmission includes a plurality of solenoids and valves in fluid communication with a 
plurality of clutch actuators and with a plurality of synchronizer actuators. The clutch actuators are operable to actuate a plurality of 
torque transmitting devices and the synchronizer actuators are operable to actuate a plurality of synchronizer assemblies. Selective 
activation of combinations of the solenoids allows for a pressurized fluid to activate at least one of the clutch actuators and 
synchronizer actuators in order to shift the transmission into a desired gear ratio.
