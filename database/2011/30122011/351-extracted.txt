(57) Abstract : 
The present invention relates to a method for producing aqueous compatible nanoparticles. More particularly, the present invention 
provides a method for producing aqueous compatible semiconductor nanoparticles by binding pre- modified ligands to the 
nanoparticles without the need for further post-binding modification to render the nanoparticles aqueous compatible. Nanoparticles 
modified in this way can exhibit enhanced fluorescence and stability compared to aqueous compatible nanoparticles producing using 
prior art methods requiring post-binding modification processes.
