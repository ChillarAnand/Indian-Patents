(57) Abstract : 
The inveniton relates to an improved concentric tube heat exchanger. The exchanger comprises a cylindrical tube (1) for circulation of 
a product provided with a flanged inlet (11) and a flanged outlet (12) of the product; a hollow body (2) concentric internally of the 
tube (1), in which the exchange fluid circulates, defining internally thereof preferential pathways for an outward and a return run of 
the exchange fluid and having the inlet and the outlet of the exchange fluid arranged at a same end of and in proximity of an end of the 
tube; a flanged inlet connector (3) for introducing the product into the tube (1), a flange (3a) of which connects with an inlet flange 
(11a) of the inlet (11) of the tube; a flanged outlet connector (4) for extracting the product from the tube (1), a flange (4a) of which 
connects with a flange (12a) of the outlet (12) of the tube; an intermediate flange (5), connected to the end of the hollow body 
exhibiting the inlet and outlet of the fluid and projecting from the tube (1), which is provided with a passage hole (5c) for the product 
to be treated and with an inlet mouth (5a) and an outlet mouth (5b) for the exchange fluid connected respectively to the outward and 
return pathway of the exchange fluid; the passage hole (5c), inlet mouth (5a) and outlet mouth (5b) not being in reciprocal connection.
