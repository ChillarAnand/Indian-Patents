(57) Abstract : 
A process of maintaining compression on a media bed in a chromatography system said process comprising the steps of: using said 
load cell to measure said force exerted on said adjustable bed support; using said sensor to measure the pressure of said fluid; 
calculating compression force on said media bed, based on measurements from said load cell and said sensor; comparing said 
calculated compression force to an optimal compression force; and using said actuator to move said adjustable bed support based on 
said comparison.
