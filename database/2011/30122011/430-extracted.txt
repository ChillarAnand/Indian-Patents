(57) Abstract : 
The invention relates to a method for producing a catalytically active absorber for desulphurizing hydrocarbon streams, wherein a) a 
mixture is produced from: - a thermally decomposable copper source; - a thermally decomposable molybdenum source; - zinc oxide; 
and - water; b) the mixture is heated to a temperature at which the thermally decomposable copper source and the thermally 
decomposable molybdenum source decomposes, with the result that a zinc oxide loaded with copper and molybdenum compounds is 
obtained; and c) calcining the zinc oxide loaded with copper and molybdenum compounds, wherein the catalytically active adsorber is 
obtained; wherein there is provided according to the invention as zinc oxide a zinc oxide with a specific surface area of more than 20 
m2/g and an average particle size D50 in the range of from 7 to 60 µm.
