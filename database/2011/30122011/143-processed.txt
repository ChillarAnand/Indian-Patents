Abstract  =>  A terminal apparatus (1), which is a radio transmitting/receiving apparatus, receives a pilot channel signal for use in measuring reception quality and a sync channel signal for use in establishing synchronization from a small-cell base station (home eNB). The terminal apparatus (1), which has stored a white list indicating accessible small cells, determines, based on the white list and the PCIs of CSG cells acquired from a sync channel, whether the CSG cell of a handover destination can be accessed. The terminal apparatus (1) then adds the PCIs and CGIs to a reception quality measurement report and transmits the measurement report to a macro eNB (base station apparatus (2)). In this way, even when a plurality of CSG cells using the same PCI exist in a macro cell, needless signalings can be suppressed, while unnecessary resources can be prevented from being allocated.
