Abstract  =>  Techniques for adaptive thread scheduling on a plurality of cores for reducing system energy are described. In one embodiment, a thread scheduler receives leakage current information associated with the plurality of cores. The leakage current information is employed to schedule a thread on one of the plurality of cores to reduce system energy usage. On chip calibration of the sensors is also described.
