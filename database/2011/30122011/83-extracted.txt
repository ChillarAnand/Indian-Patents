(57) Abstract : 
Improved screen filter modules, related compartmentalized filtration modules, and related filtration processes, suitable for filtering 
fluid to eliminate suspended particulate matter, such as living cells or microcarriers anchoring living cells, or to separate particulate 
matter based on size. The improvement is the presence of a barrier that channels redirected filtrate to the portion of the filter most 
susceptible to clogging by the particulate matter and induces flow patterns that act against clogging.
