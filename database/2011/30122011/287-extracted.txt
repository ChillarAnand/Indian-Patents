(57) Abstract : 
A method and an apparatus for implementing an optical interface with a plurality of velocities are provided, wherein the method, at 
the receiving side of the optical interface, comprises: recovering clock and data of an input data stream wherein the recovering data is 
embodied as recovering serial data into parallel data (S202); carrying out velocity detection and data detection on the recovered data 
stream, and adjusting the system into a normal operation state according to the results of the velocity detection and the data detection 
(S204); and at the transmitting side of the optical interface comprises: configuring transmission velocity according to the velocity of 
the system in the normal operation state (S206); and recovering the transmitted data from parallel data to serial data, and transmitting 
the recovered serial data (S208).
