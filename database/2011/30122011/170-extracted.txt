(57) Abstract : 
We disclose a three-ply insulating material which has combined properties of permeability to selected gases and vapors, thermal 
insulation, and humidity control. The device is built as a composite of three layers. The outer layer is made from breathable non 
woven composite. This layer is adjacent to and bonded to the middle layer, composed of high loft fibrous material with substantial 
weight to volume ratio, between about 2 to about 20 kg/m3. This middle layer is adjacent to a third layer of breathable non woven 
composite. The composite layered structure so designed forms an insulation blanket with thermal resistance of about 0.8m2 Â°K/W and 
moisture vapor transmission rate (MVTR) between 50 and 10000 l/m2/hr.
