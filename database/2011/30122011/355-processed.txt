Abstract  =>  A sliding door for a motor vehicle includes a guide rail and a sliding carriage which is longitudinally displaceably journaled at the guide rail and which is connected to the vehicle body by a multijoint. The sliding door furthermore includes a centering (42) at its end remote from the multijoint which is releasably connectable to a counter-bearing (48) at the body side.
