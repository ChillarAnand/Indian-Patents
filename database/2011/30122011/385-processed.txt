Abstract  =>  A hydraulic control system for a dual clutch transmission includes a plurality of solenoids and valves in fluid communication with a plurality of clutch actuators and with a plurality of synchronizer actuators. The clutch actuators are operable to actuate a plurality of torque transmitting devices and the synchronizer actuators are operable to actuate a plurality of synchronizer assemblies. Selective activation of combinations of the solenoids allows for a pressurized fluid to activate at least one of the clutch actuators and synchronizer actuators in order to shift the transmission into a desired gear ratio.
