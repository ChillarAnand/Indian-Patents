Abstract  =>  Systems and methodologies are described that facilitate synchronizing base stations in a wireless communication environment. A base station can receive a synchronization signal sent via a low reuse channel, which can be shared by a group of base stations. Further, the base station can align a clock associated therewith to the received synchronization signal. Moreover, the base station can coarsely align the clock to a first synchronization signal received upon a first subset of resources of the low reuse channel, and finely align the clock to a second synchronization signal received upon a second subset of resources (e.g., of the low reuse channel, of a separate channel, Â¦), where the second subset of resources can be reserved for transmission from at least one base station with at least a predetermined level of synchronous accuracy.
