Abstract  =>  To solve or mitigate the problem of lacking the last mile connection to a power grid, the invention provides a power supply apparatus for supplying electric energy to a plurality of devices. The apparatus comprises a power dock configured to electrically couple to a power pack, wherein the power pack is configured to store electric energy; and a plurality of connectors each being configured to supply electric energy from the power dock to one of the plurality of devices. By utilizing the power pack, particularly a removable super capacitor, accessing power becomes easier for those people living away from power grids or suffering from an unstable power supply.
