(57) Abstract : 
The present invention relates to a process for preparing a cyclic diamine, comprising the reaction of at least one cyclic alkene with a 
gas mixture (G) comprising dinitrogen monoxide to give at least one cyclic ketone and the subsequent conversion of the at least one 
cyclic ketone to a cyclic diamine. The invention also relates to the use of a cyclic diamine with primary and secondary amine 
functions thus obtained to prepare polyamides and polyurethanes.
