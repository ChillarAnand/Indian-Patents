(57) Abstract : 
A light collection device includes a light guide body (180) and a plurality of spaced-apart slits (100). The slits (100) are formed by 
undercuts in the light guide body (180). Sides of the slits (100) form facets that redirect light impinging on the facets (100). In some 
embodiments, the light collection body (180) is attached to a photovoltaic cell (200). Light impinging on the light collection body is 
redirected towards the photovoltaic cell (200) by the slits (100). The photovoltaic cells (200) convert the light into electrical energy.
