(57) Abstract : 
The female quick coupling element is fitted with at least one locking member (40) movable in a housing (27) between a first position 
in which a fraction (46) of the locking member projects out from the housing (27) and a second position in which the fraction (46) of 
the locking member is disengaged from a groove in a male element endpiece (11) engaged in the female element. A control ring that is 
slidable relative to the body of the female element parallel to its central longitudinal axis (XA-X"A) is suitable for moving the locking 
member between its first and second positions. The locking member (40) is provided with at least one surface (42, 43) in the form of a 
portion of a sphere. The locking member moves between its first and second positions by pivoting about a fixed axis passing through 
the center of curvature (C40) of the surface (42, 43) in the form of a portion of a sphere of the locking member (40) and perpendicular 
to the central longitudinal axis (XA-X"A) of the female element.
