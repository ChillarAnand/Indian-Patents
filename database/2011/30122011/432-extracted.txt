(57) Abstract : 
Methods and devices are provided for anchoring suture to tissue, incorporating anchoring devices constructed substantially from 
suture. The anchoring devices are constructed as longitudinally extended, preformed knot configurations that upon deployment are 
reconfigured to form anchoring knots having an increased cross-section relative to the preformed knot configuration, for secure 
lodging in tissue. The anchoring devices are suitable for single and multi-anchor surgical procedures in soft tissue or bone, and 
multiple anchors can be delivered using a single delivery device.
