(57) Abstract : 
Files stored, or to be stored, in a storage device are marked either as non-discardable or as discardable in a file system structure 
associated with a storage device. Each discardable file has associated with it a discarding priority level. A publisher file is permitted to 
be stored in the storage device only if storing the publisher file does not narrow a storage usage safety margin that is reserved for user 
files. User files are allowed to be stored in the storage device even if storing them narrows the storage usage safety margin but, in such 
cases, the storage usage safety margin is restored by removing one or more discardable files from the storage device. A discardable 
file is removed from the storage device if its discarding priority level equals or is higher than a predetermined discarding threshold 
value.
