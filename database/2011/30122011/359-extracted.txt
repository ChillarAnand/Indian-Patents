A method and control system for controlling an engine during diesel particulate filter regeneration includes a diesel particulate filter 
(DPF) regeneration request module that generates a DPF regeneration request signal. The control system also includes a DPF 
regeneration control module that controls the oxygen level in the exhaust based on an oxygen level signal corresponding to an oxygen 
level in the exhaust and a DPF inlet temperature signal corresponding to the DPF inlet temperature.
