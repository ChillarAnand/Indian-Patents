(57) Abstract : 
A method and apparatus of allocating a ranging channel in a wireless communication system is provided. A base station (BS) allocates 
at least one first ranging channel, having a first structure, and at least one second ranging channel, having a second structure, to a 
ranging subframe. The first structure or the second structure can be one of the ranging channel structures of an IEEE 802.16e system. 
A number of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) symbols included in the first structure and a number of OFDM 
symbols included in the second structure differs from each other. And a guard time including at least one OFDM symbol is allocated 
between the at least one first ranging channel and the at least one second ranging channel.
