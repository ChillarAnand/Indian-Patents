(57) Abstract : 
A workbench includes a support base, a rotation disk rotatably mounted on the support base, a rotation seat mounted on the support 
base and rotated by the rotation disk, and a working table swivelably mounted on the rotation seat. The working table has two opposite 
working zones each having a recessed and tapered profile. Thus, the working table on the rotation seat has two working zones so that 
when the workpiece is positioned, the working tool can be used to directly work the two opposite faces of the workpiece by rotation of 
the rotation seat and the working table without having to turn and reposition the workpiece, thereby saving the working time, 
decreasing the cost of fabrication and enhancing the working efficiency.
