(57) Abstract : 
A hybrid control system for a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) includes a hybrid control module. The hybrid control module includes a 
first motor control module that controls output torque of a first motor. A second motor control module controls output torque of a 
second motor based on a second motor torque request signal. The second motor torque request signal is generated based on a 
transmission output torque request signal prior to startup of an engine of the HEV. An override module generates a torque override 
request signal during the startup. The first motor control module controls output torque of the first motor to crank the engine during 
the startup. The second motor control module adjusts output torque of the second motor based on the torque override request signal 
and not the transmission output torque request signal during the startup to minimize vehicle jerk during the engine start.
