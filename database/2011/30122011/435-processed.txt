Abstract  =>  A solar receiver (26) for a linear-focusing solar concentrator, comprising: - a base (28), which is elongated in a direction parallel to a focal line (A) and carries an array of strip-shaped targets (34) arranged orthogonal to said focal line (A) and set at a distance apart from one another in a direction parallel to the focal line (A); - a focusing assembly (40) including an array of optical elements (44) arranged for focusing solar radiation on said strip-shaped targets (34), the focusing assembly (40) being mobile with respect to the base (28) of the photovoltaic receiver (26) in a direction parallel to said focal line (A); and - an azimuthal pointing device (58, 60), designed to move the focusing assembly (40) with respect to said base (28) as a function of the position of the sun.
