(57) Abstract : 
A multi flow and micro channel condenser assembly specifically suited for vehicular air conditioning applications is disclosed in the 
present work as having vertically upstanding first and second manifolds (more commonly referred to as headers) and further the said 
header communicates with the inlet and outlet connections, respectively, and generally horizontally disposed tubes connected into 
such headers, wherein the second header is inbuilt with a unique tube insert arrangement to permit refrigerant gas to separate from 
refrigerant liquid to provide an upper volume of refrigerant gas and a lower volume of refrigerant liquid. The condenser may be 
provided with at least one horizontally extending member and thus as a result placing the lower volume in flow communication with 
the outlet.
