(57) Abstract : 
A method of monitoring (200) an optical fibre comprises modulating (210) an optical signal with a traffic signal; modulating (220) the 
optical signal with an incoherent optical frequency domain reflectometry, IOFDR, test signal; transmitting (230) the doubly modulated 
optical signal onto an optical fibre at a first end of the fibre; detecting (240) scattered radiation output from the first end of the fibre; 
and analysing (250) the detected scattered radiation using incoherent optical frequency domain reflectometry to determine a distance 
to a break in the optical fibre. Apparatus suitable for carrying out the method is also described, as well as an optical communications 
network employing the method.
