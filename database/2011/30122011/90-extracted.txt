The present invention relates to a method for identifying a facility on the ground or at sea, the method being implemented on an 
airborne responder linked to at least two antennas, the method comprising a step of choosing a first transmission antenna (102) and 
then a step of transmitting an interrogation message from the chosen antenna (104), the method furthermore comprising at least the 
following steps:  testing whether a response has been received by the responder (106): o if at least one response signal is received by at 
least one of the antennas, choosing a transmission antenna as a function of the response signal or signals received (110); o if no 
response message is received, choosing a different transmission antenna from the antenna that transmitted the last interrogation 
message (108); repeating the method from the step of transmitting the interrogation message (104). Figure 2 to be published.
