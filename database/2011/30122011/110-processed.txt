Abstract  =>  Provided is a method of manufacturing a photovoltatic cell according to the present invention, the photovoltatic cell including a substrate, and a structure in which a first conductive layer, a photoelectric conversion layer and a second conductive layer are superposed on the substrate in this order; the structure is electrically separated by a predetermined size to form a plurality of compartment elements; and the compartment elements adjacent to each other are electrically connected to each other, the method including: a defect region specifying step of specifying a region in which a structural defect exists from the plurality of compartment elements; and a repairing step of irradiating the region or the periphery thereof with a laser beam to remove the structural defect, wherein the repairing step includes a step a of irradiating the structure with a first laser to remove or separate the region, and a step P of irradiating an end portion of the structure generated by the removal or separation with a second laser to clean the end portion, and wherein the second laser uses a laser obtained by defocusing the first laser so that a focus position thereof is away from the substrate.
