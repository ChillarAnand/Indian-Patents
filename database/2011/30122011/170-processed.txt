Abstract  =>  We disclose a three-ply insulating material which has combined properties of permeability to selected gases and vapors, thermal insulation, and humidity control. The device is built as a composite of three layers. The outer layer is made from breathable non woven composite. This layer is adjacent to and bonded to the middle layer, composed of high loft fibrous material with substantial weight to volume ratio, between about 2 to about 20 kg/m3. This middle layer is adjacent to a third layer of breathable non woven composite. The composite layered structure so designed forms an insulation blanket with thermal resistance of about 0.8m2 Â°K/W and moisture vapor transmission rate (MVTR) between 50 and 10000 l/m2/hr.
