Embodiments disclosed herein are directed to systems and methods for managing digital media content within a quick service 
restaurant environment to provide a consistent visual experience and accurate, timely data across various digital media displays to 
QSR customers. In some embodiments, a digital media management appliance (DMMA) is used to manage the distribution of digital 
media data which is used to drive various display devices present in the QSR environment. The DMMA may be configured to extract 
data from a point of sale (POS) system and/or other data sources within the QSR environment in order to generate display data for the 
digital media devices in the store.
