(57) Abstract : 
A method (200) for enabling compatibility of wireless devices having different regulation settings. The method comprises upon 
initialization of a wireless device, scanning a predefined common channel (S220); forming a WiNet service set (WSS) by wireless 
devices communicating over the predefined common channel (S230); upon switching of the wireless devices in the WSS to a channel 
other than the predefined common channel, checking if a new wireless device attempts to join the WSS (S240, S250); and adding the 
new wireless device to the WSS if such attempt was detected (S290). Fig.2
