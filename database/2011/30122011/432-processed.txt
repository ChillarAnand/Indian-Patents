Abstract  =>  Methods and devices are provided for anchoring suture to tissue, incorporating anchoring devices constructed substantially from suture. The anchoring devices are constructed as longitudinally extended, preformed knot configurations that upon deployment are reconfigured to form anchoring knots having an increased cross-section relative to the preformed knot configuration, for secure lodging in tissue. The anchoring devices are suitable for single and multi-anchor surgical procedures in soft tissue or bone, and multiple anchors can be delivered using a single delivery device.
