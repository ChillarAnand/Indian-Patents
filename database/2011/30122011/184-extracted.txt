(57) Abstract : 
According to one embodiment of the present invention, a rotating blade, having a collision face that collides with fluid and is rotated 
by the flow of said fluid, has at least one flow path that has been caved in from said colliding face; said flow path is located forward 
with respect to said rotation direction so that it is located in the rear with respect to the inlet wherein said flow is introduced and said 
rotation direction, and it has an outlet from which said fluid exits. Here, the cross-sectional area of said inlet may be greater than the 
cross-sectional area of said outlet. In addition, the cross-sectional area of said inlet may gradually decrease toward said outlet.
