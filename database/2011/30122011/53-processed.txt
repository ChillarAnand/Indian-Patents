Abstract  =>  A turbine system includes a turbine positioned so that its blades are exposed during at least part of their rotation to a region of fluid flow accelerated by a columnar structure, such as a building or a bridge pylon. A protective casing moves to isolate the turbine blades from the fluid flow, thereby protecting the turbine from overpowering conditions. Upwind and downwind fairings may be used when retrofitting pre-existing buildings. Turbines may be positioned on opposing sides of a building. Multiple turbine modules may be positioned in line along peripheries of a building. Turbines may be mounted on in-water structures, such as buoys.
