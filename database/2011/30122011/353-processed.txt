Abstract  =>  An automated start/stop system for a vehicle comprises an auto-stop module, a diagnostic module, and an auto-start module. The auto- stop module selectively initiates an auto-stop event and shuts down an engine while the vehicle is running. The diagnostic module selectively diagnoses a fault in a clutch pedal position sensor of the vehicle. The auto-start module, while the vehicle is running and the engine is shut down, selectively initiates an auto-start event after the fault has been diagnosed when current drawn by a starter motor is less than a predetermined maximum starting current.
