(57) Abstract : 
Device for x-ray material testing of test objects (15), including an x-ray device (20) which comprises an x-ray source (12) for 
irradiating a test object held (15) in the testing position and an x-ray detector (13) which is a line detector, and an electronic control 
device (38) which is adapted to control the x-ray device (20), wherein during x-ray testing the test object (15) and the x-ray device 
(20) can be rotated relative to each other around an essentially vertical rotational axis R, only, characterized in that the x-ray detector 
(13) comprises at least two detecting portions (13A, 13B, ...) , each of which is adapted to detect the test object throughout a full radial 
cross-section (52A, 52B, ...) .
