Abstract  =>  In a method and a device for opening printed products (26), folded printed products (20) are held on a back (28) and transported. Thereby, they are aligned at an edge region (44) lying opposite the back (28). for example by way of co-running lugs (98"). Subsequently, the edge region (44) is encompassed by a holding element (50) and held in a preferably loose manner. Preferably, the uppermost sheet of the printed product (26) is gripped with a revolving opening element (72) engaging on the printed product (26) behind the edge region (44), and pulled out of the holding element (50), whilst the remaining sheet or the remaining sheets of the printed product (26) remain in the holding element (50). After moving a holding-open element (102) into the printed product (26) opened in such a manner, the holding element (50) moves away to the bottom and thus the edge region (44) of the printed product (26) slips out of the holding element (50).
