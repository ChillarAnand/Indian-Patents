(57) Abstract : 
Methods, systems, and computer readable media for performing triggerless mobile location-based screening and routing are disclosed. 
According to one aspect, the subject matter described herein includes a method for performing triggerless mobile location-based 
screening and routing. A telecommunications network element receives a mobility management message associated with a mobile 
subscriber, extracts from the mobility management message information identifying the mobile subscriber and location information 
associated with the mobile subscriber, and stores the extracted location information associated with the mobile subscriber. The 
network element receives a call setup message associated with a call from the mobile subscriber, extracts from the call setup message 
information identifying the mobile subscriber, retrieves the stored location information associated with the mobile subscriber, and 
performs a screening or routing function based on the location information associated with the mobile subscriber.
