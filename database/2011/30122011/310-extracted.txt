(57) Abstract : 
Provided is a flexible substrate wherein a connection portion between the flexible substrate and an electric circuit board meets 
requirements of narrow wiring pitch and low resistance at the connection portion. An electric circuit structure, which has the flexible 
substrate and the electric circuit board to which the flexible substrate is connected, is also provided. A wiring pattern (22) is formed on 
a flexible base film (21), a connection terminal (25) connected electrically to an electrode terminal of another electric circuit board is 
arranged at an end portion of the wiring pattern (22), and the connection terminal (25) includes wide connection terminals (25b, 25c) 
having a terminal width extending across plural lines of the wiring pattern (22). [Figure 2]
