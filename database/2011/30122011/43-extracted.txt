(57) Abstract : 
The invention provides an actinically-crosslinkable linear polysiloxane copolymer. The actinically-crosslinkable polysiloxane 
copolymer can be used to prepare a silicone hdyrogel contact lens having a hydrophilic surface without post-curing surface treatment. 
The invention is also related to a silicone hydrogel contact lens obtained from a lens-forming material including an actinically-
crosslinkable polysiloxane copolymer of the invention and to a method for making an actinically-crosslinkable polysiloxane 
copolymer of the invention. In addition, the invention provides a non-crosslinkable linear polysiloxane copolymer capable of being 
used as a internal wetting agent which can render the surface of a silicone hydrogel contact lens hydrophilic.
