(57) Abstract : 
An electrically controlled turbocharger has a motor mounted on a shaft in a motor housing between a turbine and compressor. Oil is 
sprayed onto the motor stator to cool the stator. In the case of a single shaft, a shaft stiffener is placed between the motor rotor and the 
shaft. Several embodiments of ECTs are discussed with single and concentric shafts as well as single and dual stages of compressors 
and turbines. Lubrication embodiments involve overcoming the centrifugal forces present in rotating shafts.
