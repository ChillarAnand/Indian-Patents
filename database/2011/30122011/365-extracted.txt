(57) Abstract : 
A super-gather is constructed by interleaving traces from a hydrophone gather and a geophone gather in seismic data such that traces 
pertaining to co-located hydrophones and geophones are adjacent to each other. A noise-attenuated super-gather, generated by 
applying an f-x domain noise identifying and attenuation process to the super-gather, is subtracted from the super-gather to generate a 
super-gather noise model. A hydrophone gather noise model, generated by removing non-noisy geophone gather traces from the 
super- gather noise model, is subtracted from the hydrophone gather to generate seismic data with interference noise attenuated.
