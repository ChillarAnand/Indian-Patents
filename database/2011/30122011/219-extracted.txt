(57) Abstract : 
The invention relates to a coating tool for applying a fluid film onto a substrate, wherein disposed upstream of a slot nozzle (1) for 
producing a fluid film, nozzle extending substantially across the entirety of a first width (B1) of the coating tool in unbroken fashion, 
is a distribution space (7) for distributing the fluid over a second width (B2) of the slot nozzle (1), wherein at least one channel (6) for 
feeding fluid is provided upstream of the distribution space (7), channel having a third width (B3), and wherein the third width (B3) is 
smaller than the second width (B2). To avoid an uneven throughput of material across the width of the slot, it is proposed according to 
the invention that a plurality of feed channels (9) be disposed in the distribution space (7), channels having a cross sectional area that 
increases in the direction of flow (S).
