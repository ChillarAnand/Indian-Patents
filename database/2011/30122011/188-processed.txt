Abstract  =>  A semiconductor layer (100) includes an upper surface (100o), a lower surface (100u), and a side surface (100s). In the vicinity of the boundary between the side surface (100s) and the upper surface (100o) on the side surface (100s), the tangent (T1) of the boundary is inclined with respect to the normal of the lower surface (100u). At a portion of the side surface (100s) apart from the upper surface (100o) as compared to the vicinity of the boundary, the angle defined by the tangent (T2) of that portion and the plane defined by the lower surface (100u) is greater than the angle defined by the tangent (T1) in the vicinity of the boundary and the plane defined by the lower surface (100u).
