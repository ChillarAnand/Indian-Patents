Abstract  =>  Embodiments herein disclose a digitally precoded SC-FDMA scheme with low PAPR, where the scheme applies a constellation rotation to the M-ary input data sequence, before circularly convolving the rotated data sequence with a polynomial decoder. The data is then transformed to the frequency domain and then mapped. An N-point IIFT is then applied to the data to produce time domain samples.
