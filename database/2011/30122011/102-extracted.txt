(57) Abstract : 
The present invention relates to a platform for capturing wave energy suitable for deep and ultra-deep waters, comprising a cover (1) 
supported on a submerged hull (2) by means of hydrodynamic pillars (3) uniformly distributed along its sides. Its plan view is V-
shaped and it is self-orienting such that the wave front moves forward perpendicularly to its plane of symmetry. The wave energy is 
absorbed by means of separate capture modules (4) which, located between the pillars (3) along the sides, come into contact with the 
waves progressively as they move forward, which makes it possible to convert their periodic movement into a continuous movement. 
The platform is stabilized using large ballasts (8) connected, by means of mooring lines (9), to the lower edge of its pivot shaft (10), 
which allows it to automatically position itself correctly at all times.
