(57) Abstract : 
The invention relates to a method and apparatus for the objective detection of auditive disorders, by recording arising potentials of a 
stable state with simultaneous acoustic stimulation via the bones or the air way, to be used in new borns. The apparatus comprises the 
necessary means for the independent generation of two different sound stimuli presented to the subject simultaneously via osseous and 
air way electroacoustic transducers, the synchronous recording of the cerebral electrical activity of the subject, the continuous 
evaluation of the contact of the electrodes, the interactive measurement of the levels of ambient noise, and the wireless digital 
transmission of the bioelectric activity towards a computer. The method according to the invention statistically processes and detects 
the potentials provoked by the osseous-air way stimulation, automatically providing a categorical final result, according to the 
presence or absence of auditive sensitivity disorders, the type of disorder (conductive or sensorineural), and the validity of the result.
