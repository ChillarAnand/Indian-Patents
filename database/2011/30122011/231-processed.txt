Abstract  =>  A 3-D picture is provided as follows. A pair of pictures (LP, RP) is provided that comprises a first picture (LP) being intended for one eye of a viewer, and a second picture (RP) being intended for the other eye of the viewer. In addition, a depth map (DM) specifically dedicated to the first picture (LP) is provided. The depth map (DM) comprises depth indication values. A depth indication value relates to a particular portion of the first picture (LP) and indicates a distance between an object at least partially represented by that portion of the first picture and the viewer. Such a 3-D picture allows a satisfactory 3-D visual rendering on a great variety of display devices. Preferably, the 3-D picture is supplemented with rendering guidance data (GD) that specifies respective parameters for respective rendering contexts. Fig. 2
