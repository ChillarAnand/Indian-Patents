(57) Abstract : 
Compositions and methods for enhancing and/or prolonging the activation of T cells (i.e., increasing antigen-specific proliferation of 
T cells, enhancing cytokine production by T cells, stimulating differentiation ad effector functions of T cells and/or promoting T cell 
survival) or overcoming T cell exhaustion and/or anergy are provided. Suitable compositions include PD-1 receptor antagonists that 
bind to and block the endogenous PD-1 receptor without triggering inhibitory signals from PD-1, or bind to and block PD-1 receptor 
ligands and preventing them from interacting with PD-1 receptors. Methods for using the PD-1 receptor antagonists to enhance 
immune responses in subjects in need thereof are provided.
