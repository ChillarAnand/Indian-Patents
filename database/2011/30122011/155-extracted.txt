(57) Abstract : 
Systems and methods of high dynamic range image combining are disclosed. In a particular embodiment, a device includes a global 
mapping module configured to generate first globally mapped luminance values within a region of an image, a local mapping module 
configured to generate second locally mapped luminance values within the region of the image, and a combination module configured 
to determine luminance values within a corresponding region of an output image using a weighted sum of the first globally mapped 
luminance values and the second locally mapped luminance values. A weight of the weighted sum is at least partially based on a 
luminance variation within the region of the image.
