(57) Abstract : 
A method of manufacturing a foam product, the method comprising the steps of: molding the foam product by placing liquid foam 
materials in a mold cavity and reacting the liquid foam materials in the mold cavity to create the foam product; de-molding the foam 
product by removing the foam product from the mold cavity; post-curing the foam product immediately after de-molding the foam 
product from the mold cavity and prior to crushing the foam product, to thereby maintain the elevated core temperature of the foam 
product and to melt the outer surface of the foam product to form a higher density gradient thereon by continuing to heat the foam 
product for between approximately two and fifteen minutes to form the higher surface densification thereon and thereby reduce set 
damage to the foam product; rapidly cooling the foam product to enable the foam product to be compressed from approximately 
twenty-five to ninety-five percent of its thickness and thereby maximize the durability of the foam product; and compressing the fully 
cured foam product from approximately fifteen and fifty percent of its dimension when packaged for shipment.
