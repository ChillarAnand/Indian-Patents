(57) Abstract : 
A light guide device includes a light guide body 182 and two or more pluralities of spaced-apart slits 100. The slits 100 are formed by 
undercuts in the light guide body 182. Sidewalls of the slits form facets that redirect light impinging on the facets. In some 
embodiments, the light guide body is attached to a light source 192. The light source 192 emits light that is injected into the light guide 
body 182 and the slits 100 redirect the light out of the light guide body 182 and towards a desired target. In some embodiments, the 
target is a display and a first plurality of slits 100 directs light from the light source 192 across the light guide body 182 and over the 
face of the display. A second plurality of slits 100 then directs light out of the light guide body 182 and towards the display.
