A rotary atomizer is presented comprising a rotor (8), having a plurality of insert holders (20) along the perimeter of rotor (8); and a 
plurality of metal foam inserts (12) placed between insert holders (20) that act as nozzles of the rotary atomizer. Rotor (8) is 
characterized in an assembly wherein insert holders (20) secure the position of metal foam inserts (12). Rotor (8) can be disc shaped. 
A protection plate (10) is fixed to a stationary shaft (1) of the atomizer to prevent physical contact with rotor (8) without obstructing 
the atomizer output.
