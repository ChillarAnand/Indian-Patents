(57) Abstract : 
A diaphragm failure monitoring system for detecting leakage in a diaphragm of a diaphragm pump. The system includes a pump 
having an operating chamber containing a working fluid and a pumping chamber for pumping material into and out of the pump and a 
diaphragm separating the operating and pumping chambers. A first optic fiber is joined to the operating chamber for transmitting an 
optic signal across the working fluid. A second optic fiber is joined to the operating chamber for receiving the optic signal from the 
first optic fiber. An electric signal establishing device establishes a first electrical signal when the optic signal from the first optic fiber 
to the second optic fiber passes through uncontarninated working fluid. The electric signal establishing device establishes a second 
electrical signal when the optic signal from the first optic fiber to the second optic fiber passes through contaminated working fluid, 
whereby leakage of a contaminating material through the diaphragm into the operating chamber can be detected when the second 
electrical signal is established.
