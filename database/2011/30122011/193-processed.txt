Abstract  =>  An improved method and device for safe and efficient medical applications is provided. In a preferred embodiment, based on using the inherent benefits of laser diodes (such as efficient power generation from a reliable and compact solid state device), plasmas and high energy vapors are produced for medical applications with power levels and power densities sufficient to treat medical indications and avoid the creation of extensive damage zones. Transmissions means in different configurations are used to achieve a high power density, which is able to initiate plasma and high-energy vapor at the tip. Once a sparkless plasma and high energy vapor bubbles are formed, it is often found that it will also absorb other wavelengths in addition to the one that initiated it. As a consequence, other wavelengths more efficiently generated by diodes or diode pumped lasers may be added into the beam in order to improve treatment efficiency. For example, the 1470 nm wavelength can be used to produces sparkler-less plasma bubbles, together with the 980nm wavelength to produce tissue vaporization and an excellent haemostasis effect. Once plasma and or high-energy vapors are in place, radiation from this zone determine tissue effects. In another embodiment, high peak power pulsed radiation is used. Wavelengths of 1470 nm, 1940 nm, or 1550 nm are preferred. Additionally it can be applied in combination with another wavelength with medium absorption in water such as 980 nm. In another embodiment a concentric double core fiber is used, in which the ignition radiation is guided in near single mode, inner core and the radiation used to maintain and enhance the pulse is guided into the surrounding second outer core.
