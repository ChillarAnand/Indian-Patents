Abstract  =>  A media container file (30) is generated by organizing encoded video data representative of multiple camera views (22-28) of a video content as one or more video tracks (32) in the media container file (30). A view arrangement representation (34) indicative of a predefined deployment and position relationships of camera views (22-28) is selected among multiple different such predefined view arrangement representations. The view identifiers (36) of the multiple camera views (22-28) are included in the selected view arrangement representation (34). The view arrangement representation (34) with the included view identifiers (36) is organized in the media container file (30) relative the at least one video track (32). (Fig. 1)
