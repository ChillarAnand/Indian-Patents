Abstract  =>  This invention is a method of minimizing the variation of cell growth and production through homogeneous cell line development. To be more specific, it is the method of isolating and proliferating single cell clone from the cambium to promote the stability of the plant-derived biologically active substances production by solving the problems of decrease in cell growth and the productivity during the long term culture.
