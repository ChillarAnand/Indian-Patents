(57) Abstract : 
Optically active amine derivatives are produced by acting on inline derivatives with a culture of microorganisms having the ability to 
stereoselectively reduce the compounds, microbial cells, or processed products thereof, followed by collecting the generated optically 
active amine derivatives. Optically active amine derivatives obtained in the present invention are useful as materials for 
pharmaceutical agents. The present invention enables, for example, production of an optically active compound represented by 
formula (IV): formula (IV): (wherein R group represents an alkyl group having one to three carbon atoms; and n represents an integer 
of 1 to 4).
