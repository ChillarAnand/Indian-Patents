Abstract  =>  The present invention disclosed a method for making heat-insulated paper containers and the products made by the same. The method includes steps of : (a) mixing and blending polyethylene terephalate or polypropylene with an adhesive to form a polymer material; (b) heating and extruding the polymer material with an extruder machine to form a film and coating a surface of paper with the film; (c) cooling and laminating the paper with a laminating roller; (d) continuously coating another surface of the paper with a foam material; and then furling the paper after drying; and cutting the paper into a semi-product and then molding into a paper container; (e) heating the foam material with a heating device. The method of the present invention can enhance the foam uniformity and the production rate, and decrease the defective rate.
