Abstract  =>  A device (10) for x-ray material testing of test objects (15) includes a translational conveyor device (14) for automatically serially feeding and discharging test objects (15) to or from a testing position and an x-ray device (20) comprising an x-ray source (12) for irradiating a test object (15) held in the testing position on a carrier (33) and an x-ray detector (13), wherein the test object (15) and the x-ray device (20) can be rotated relative to each other around an essentially vertical rotational axis R, only, during x-ray testing. According to one aspect of the invention, the carrier (33) together with the test object (15) held thereon can be rotated as a whole around the rotational axis R for the x-ray testing. According to a further aspect of the invention, the x-ray device (20) can be rotated as a whole around the rotational axis R for the x-ray testing. The carrier (33) is a translational conveyor device for the test object.
