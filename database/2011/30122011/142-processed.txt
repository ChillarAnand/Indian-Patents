Abstract  =>  A resistance based memory circuit is disclosed. The circuit includes a first transistor load of a data cell and a bit line adapted to detect a first logic state. The bit line is coupled to the first transistor load and coupled to a data cell having a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) structure. The bit line is adapted to detect data having a logic one value when the bit line has a first voltage value, and to detect data having a logic zero value when the bit line has a second voltage value. The circuit further includes a second transistor load of a reference cell. The second transistor load is coupled to the first transistor load, and the second transistor load has an associated reference voltage value. A characteristic of the first transistor load, such as transistor width, is adjustable to modify the first voltage value and the second voltage value without substantially changing the reference voltage value.
