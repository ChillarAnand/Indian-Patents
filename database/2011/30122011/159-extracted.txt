(57) Abstract : 
In one embodiment, a method of generating annotation tags (28) for a digital image (22) includes maintaining a library (16) of human-
meaningful words or phrases organized as category entries (72) according to a number of defined image description categories (70), 
and receiving context metadata (20) associated with the capture of a given digital image (22). The method further includes selecting 
particular category entries (72-1, 72-2) as vocabulary metadata (24) for the digital image (22) by mapping the context metadata (20) 
into the library (16), and generating annotation tags (28) for the digital image (22) by logically combining the vocabulary metadata 
(24) according to a defined set of deductive logic rules (30) that are predicated on the defined image description categories (70). In 
another embodiment, a processing apparatus (12), such as a digital processor (18, 26) and supporting memory (14), etc., is configured 
to carry out the above method, or to carry out variations of the above method.
