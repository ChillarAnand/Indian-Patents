(57) Abstract : 
An automated start/stop system for a vehicle comprises an auto-stop module, a diagnostic module, and an auto-start module. The auto-
stop module selectively initiates an auto-stop event and shuts down an engine while the vehicle is running. The diagnostic module 
selectively diagnoses a fault in a clutch pedal position sensor of the vehicle. The auto-start module, while the vehicle is running and 
the engine is shut down, selectively initiates an auto-start event after the fault has been diagnosed when current drawn by a starter 
motor is less than a predetermined maximum starting current.
