Abstract  =>  Systems and methods of high dynamic range image combining are disclosed. In a particular embodiment, a device includes a global mapping module configured to generate first globally mapped luminance values within a region of an image, a local mapping module configured to generate second locally mapped luminance values within the region of the image, and a combination module configured to determine luminance values within a corresponding region of an output image using a weighted sum of the first globally mapped luminance values and the second locally mapped luminance values. A weight of the weighted sum is at least partially based on a luminance variation within the region of the image.
