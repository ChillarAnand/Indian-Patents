Abstract  =>  A method of applying a coating (17) of a thermoplastic material on a substrate (11) made of a polymeric material, wherein said thermoplastic material and said polymeric material are incompatible, comprising the following steps. Firstly, exposing the substrate and/or the powder to a plasma discharge (12) or the reactive gas stream resulting therefrom in order to obtain a plasma treated surface layer (14) introducing compatibility at the interface between substrate and coating. Secondly, laser cladding (15) the powder (16) on the substrate in order to form a coating on the substrate.
