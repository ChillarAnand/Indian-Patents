Abstract  =>  In the inventive method for the manufacture of spatial objects of a fleece or felt, the fibers are deposited on a mold that is preferably air-permeable. The fibers may be attracted to the mold by a vacuum applied to the underside of said mold. Preferably, the mold has several spatial structures that define the shape of the fiber web that is being formed and that correspond at least approximately to the desired final shape. By subsequent compacting of the thusly obtained fiber web, a spatially three-dimensional felt object is obtained. In this method, subsequent deforming steps are unnecessary or reduced to a minimum, so that the material to be produced does not experience any substantial distortion.
