(57) Abstract : 
A system (2000) for communicating information between at least two medical devices implanted within the body of a subject using 
volume conduction of electrical signals as a means of communication and wherein one of the implanted medical devices is configured 
to provide electrical stimulation to the tissue is disclosed. The system comprises a first implant device (202) having at least two 
transmit electrodes (204, 206) configured to transmit electrical stimulation pulses, wherein one of the electrodes may be a common 
return electrode, an encoding means (240) configured to employ a channel as a transmission medium for stimulation pulses and 
encoding the information into the stimulation pulses, a second implant device (252) having at least two receive electrodes (254, 256)
