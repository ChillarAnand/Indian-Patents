(57) Abstract : 
A hydraulic fluid circuit for a power transmission device includes a first hydraulic circuit segment fluidly decoupled from a second 
hydraulic circuit segment. A hydraulic pump includes a first fluidic pumping element and a second fluidic pumping element. The first 
fluidic pumping element fluidly communicates with the first hydraulic circuit segment. The second fluidic pumping element fluidly 
communicates with the second hydraulic circuit segment. The first fluidic pumping element is controllable to a first pump operating 
point to achieve a preferred high fluidic flow rate in the first hydraulic circuit segment. The second fluidic pumping element is 
controllable to a second pump operating point to achieve a preferred high fluidic pressure in the second hydraulic circuit segment.
