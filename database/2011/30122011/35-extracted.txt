(57) Abstract : 
A technology for the biodegradation of polyethylene by consortium of bacterial strains having accession numbers MTCC , MTCC and 
MTCC . The bacterial consortium synergistically brings about degradation of polyethylene. The process involves exposure of 
polyethylene strips cut and shredded in an inorganic nutrient medium containing the bacterial consortium capable of utilizing 
polyethylene as the sole source of carbon and energy. The process described in the embodiment facilitates the biodegradation of 
polyethylene in an eco-friendly, safe, efficient and cost effective manner.
