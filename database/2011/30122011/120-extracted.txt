(57) Abstract : 
Apparatuses, systems and methods for reducing power consumption during standby operation of a mobile device are disclosed. A page 
decoding algorithm can be stored in nonvolatile memory during standby. The page decoding algorithm can be executed from the 
nonvolatile memory, when the mobile device is awakened from a sleep state to determine if there is any activity such as an incoming 
call. No power is required for the nonvolatile memory to maintain storage of the algorithm so that the power requirement during 
standby of the mobile device is reduced.
