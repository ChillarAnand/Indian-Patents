Abstract  =>  The liquid crystal display (100) comprises an active matrix substrate (220) having a pixel electrode (224); a counter substrate (240) having a counter electrode (244); a vertical orientation-type liquid crystal layer (260); and orientation-preserving layers (210, 230) disposed between the active matrix substrate (220) and the liquid crystal layer (260), and the counter substrate (240) and the liquid crystal layer (260). The orientation-preserving layers (210, 230) comprise a polymer (poa) obtained by polymerization of a polyfunctional monomer. The active matrix substrate and/or the counter substrate further have orientation films (110, 120) disposed on the liquid crystal layer side, and the orientation films (110, 120) comprise a polyimide (pi) and a polymer (pob) obtained by polymerization of a polyfunctional monomer.
