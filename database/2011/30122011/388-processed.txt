Abstract  =>  In a device for treating sheet-like substrates with light provision is made for a suction table (5) which is provided with a circulating suction strip (4) for transporting the sheet-like substrates, which suction strip forms a descending loop (10) relative to its table-parallel transport level (a), such loop comprising a descending branch (11) and, adjacent to the latter, an ascending branch (12), with a gap for the passage of light between the descending branch (11) and the ascending branch (12) of the suction strip (4) being bridged by a stationary bridging member (14) which at least partially allows light to pass through it and whose surface (b) is disposed at a level slightly recessed relative to the parallel transport level (a). Thus, a high degree of accuracy and trouble-free operation are ensured even at high transport speeds.
