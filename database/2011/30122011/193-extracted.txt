(57) Abstract : 
An improved method and device for safe and efficient medical applications is provided. In a preferred embodiment, based on using the 
inherent benefits of laser diodes (such as efficient power generation from a reliable and compact solid state device), plasmas and high 
energy vapors are produced for medical applications with power levels and power densities sufficient to treat medical indications and 
avoid the creation of extensive damage zones. Transmissions means in different configurations are used to achieve a high power 
density, which is able to initiate plasma and high-energy vapor at the tip. Once a sparkless plasma and high energy vapor bubbles are 
formed, it is often found that it will also absorb other wavelengths in addition to the one that initiated it. As a consequence, other 
wavelengths more efficiently generated by diodes or diode pumped lasers may be added into the beam in order to improve treatment 
efficiency. For example, the 1470 nm wavelength can be used to produces sparkler-less plasma bubbles, together with the 980nm 
wavelength to produce tissue vaporization and an excellent haemostasis effect. Once plasma and or high-energy vapors are in place, 
radiation from this zone determine tissue effects. In another embodiment, high peak power pulsed radiation is used. Wavelengths of 
1470 nm, 1940 nm, or 1550 nm are preferred. Additionally it can be applied in combination with another wavelength with medium 
absorption in water such as 980 nm. In another embodiment a concentric double core fiber is used, in which the ignition radiation is 
guided in near single mode, inner core and the radiation used to maintain and enhance the pulse is guided into the surrounding second 
outer core.
