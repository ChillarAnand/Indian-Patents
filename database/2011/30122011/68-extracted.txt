(57) Abstract : 
A turbine for capturing energy from a fluid moving from an from an upstream direction to a downstream direction, said turbine 
comprising: (A) a drive shaft having an axis of rotation, a first end, and a second end remote from the first end along the axis of 
rotation; (B) a drive hub coupled to the drive shaft proximately to the first end of the drive shaft; and (C) a plurality of airfoils, each 
airfoil having an airfoil axis along a span, each airfoil being coupled to the hub such that (i) the airfoil is configured to exert a 
rotational torque about the drive shaft axis of rotation in response to the fluid flow, and (ii) the airfoil is pivotal between a first 
position with its airfoil axis generally parallel to the flow direction and a second position with its airfoil axis substantially normal to 
the flow direction; and (D) an actuator coupled to the airfoils so as to move the airfoils between the second position toward the first 
position.
