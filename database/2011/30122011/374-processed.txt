Abstract  =>  The present invention relates to an angle adjuster for a bicycle saddle that is disposed between a frame of a vehicle and a saddle. The angle adjuster for a bicycle saddle includes: a frame connector connected to the frame; a saddle connector rotatably connected to the upper end of the frame connector and supporting the saddle; an angle adjusting assembly including a main clutch fixing and releasing the frame connector and the saddle connector, and controlling rotational angle of the saddle connector with respect to the frame connector by the release operation of the main clutch; an operating lever mounted on the frame to operate the main clutch; and a wire connecting the main clutch with the operating lever and operating the main clutch, when the operating lever is operated. Therefore, the angle adjuster for a bicycle saddle according to the present invention makes it possible to adjust angle of the saddle to fit the body shapes of users such that they can ride the bicycle in a comfortable position. Further, it is possible to prevent an accident by appropriately adjusting angle of the saddle such that the userâ€™s body does not inclined in one direction, when going up or coming down a slope. In particular, it is possible for the users to freely adjust the angle and height of the saddle by operating the operating lever while the bicycle runs, thereby providing the users with convenience.
