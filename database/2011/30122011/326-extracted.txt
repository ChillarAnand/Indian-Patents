(57) Abstract : 
Acetyl anhydrides such as acetyl sulfate are produced by a process for comprising contacting methane and carbon dioxide in an 
anhydrous environment in the presence of effective amounts of a transition metal catalyst and a reaction promoter, and an acid 
anhydride compound, and optionally an acid. The acetyl anhydride can be contacted with water to produce acetic acid or with an 
alcohol to produce a product comprising an acetate ester and that may also comprise acetic acid. Optionally, water in stoichiometric 
amounts or less, with respect to the acetic anhydride, may be fed to a continuous process of this type to produce some acetic acid in 
situ.
