(57) Abstract : 
To solve or mitigate the problem of lacking the last mile connection to a power grid, the invention provides a power supply 
apparatus for supplying electric energy to a plurality of devices. The apparatus comprises a power dock configured to electrically 
couple to a power pack, wherein the power pack is configured to store electric energy; and a plurality of connectors each being 
configured to supply electric energy from the power dock to one of the plurality of devices. By utilizing the power pack, particularly a 
removable super capacitor, accessing power becomes easier for those people living away from power grids or suffering from an 
unstable power supply. (Fig. 2)
