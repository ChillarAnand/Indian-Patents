Abstract  =>  To perform zone-based workload scheduling according to environmental conditions in a system having electronic devices, indicators of cooling efficiencies of the electronic devices in corresponding zones are aggregated (206, 406, 510) to form aggregated indicators for respective zones, where the zones include respective subsets of electronic devices. Workload is assigned (208, 408) to the electronic devices according to the aggregated indicators. [FIG. 2]
