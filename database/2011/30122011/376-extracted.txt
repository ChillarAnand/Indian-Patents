(57) Abstract : 
The present invention relates to one or more electrode plates, which are installed with collecting current terminals at two or more sides 
thereof, clipping with an auxiliary conductor made of the material with conductivity better than that of the electrode plates; in which 
collecting current terminals are installed at two or more sides of the auxiliary conductor, for linking with the collecting current 
terminals installed at two or more sides of the electrode plates, and at least one of which are used to be the general collecting current 
terminal to output current to the external part or to receive the input current from the external part; and there are insulators installed 
between the auxiliary conductor and the electrode plates to constitute an electrode unit.
