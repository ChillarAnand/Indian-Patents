(57) Abstract : 
In a particular embodiment, a method is disclosed that includes determining at least one ambient exposure parameter using an ambient 
illumination, the at least one ambient exposure parameter including a first sensitivity parameter of an autoexposure controller using 
the ambient illumination. The method includes determining at least one low illumination parameter using a first lamp level, the at least 
one low illumination parameter including a second sensitivity parameter of the autoexposure controller using the first lamp level, 
where the autoexposure controller is configured to operate according to at least one high illumination parameter based on the at least 
one ambient exposure parameter and the at least one low illumination parameter. The method further includes performing an image 
capture operation using a second lamp level that is brighter than the first lamp level, where the at least one high illumination parameter 
includes a third sensitivity parameter.
