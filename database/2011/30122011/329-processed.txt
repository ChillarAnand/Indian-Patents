Abstract  =>  A NOx removal catalyst for high-temperature flue gas according to the present invention is a NOx removal catalyst for high- temperature flue gas that contains nitrogen oxide in which tungsten oxide with the number of molecular layers of tungsten oxide (WO3) being five or less is supported on a complex oxide carrier containing titanium oxide. Even when high-temperature denitration is continued,, a bonding force with a carrier of WO3 can be properly maintained and volatilization can be suppressed while maintaining a high NOx removal performance. For example, the NOx removal catalyst is particularly suitable for reducing and removing nitrogen oxide contained in high- temperature gas discharged from a thermal power plant and a high-temperature boiler.
