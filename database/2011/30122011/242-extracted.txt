(57) Abstract : 
Described is a method for the delivery of a therapeutic agent to a mammal, particularly a human person, comprising (i) the 
administration of ultrasound particles that undergo a physical change when subjected to ultrasound; (ii) the administration of the 
therapeutic agent in an ultrasound dosage form allowing release of the therapeutic agent to be affected by the application of 
ultrasound, (iii) the application of ultrasound so as to affect a physical change in at least some of the ultrasound particles, and (iv) the 
application of ultrasound so as to stimulate release of the therapeutic agent. According to the invention the ultrasound particles are 
subjected to detection of their acoustic responses via echoes and/or emissions. The information thus obtained is processed and the 
processed information is used to adapt or adjust the ultrasound-mediated delivery of the therapeutic agent. Fig. 1
