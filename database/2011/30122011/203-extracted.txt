(57) Abstract : 
The main subject of the present invention is to provide an aluminum alloy for pressure casting having high yield strength and 
elongation, anti-soldering, and that can be substituted for ADC10 and ADC12. An aluminum alloy for pressure casting contains 4.0-
9.0 wt% Si, 0.50-1.0 wt% Mg, 0.55 wt% or less Fe, 0.30-0.60 wt% Mn, and 0.10-0.25 wt% Cr, and the balance comprising Al and 
unavoidable impurities. According to the content ratios, it is possible to provide the aluminum alloy for pressure casting, which 
exhibits superior yield strength and elongation and is less likely to solder.
