(57) Abstract : 
A calibration apparatus includes a fixture coupled to hold a distal end of a medical probe. An actuator is configured to press against 
the distal tip of the probe and apply to the distal tip multiple force vectors having respective magnitudes and angles with respect to the 
distal end, so as to cause a deformation of the distal tip relative to the distal end. A sensing device is configured to measure the 
magnitudes of the force vectors applied by the actuator. A calibration processor is configured to receive from the probe first 
measurements indicative of the deformation of the distal tip in response to the force vectors, to receive from the sensing device second 
measurements indicative of the magnitudes of the force vectors, and to compute, based on the angles and the first and second 
measurements, calibration coefficients for assessing the force vectors as a function of the first measurements.
