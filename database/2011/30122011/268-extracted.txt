(57) Abstract : 
Systems and methodologies are described herein that facilitate techniques for managing respective original transmissions and re-
transmissions of information within a wireless communication system. Various mechanisms are described herein for processing a new 
data indicator (NDI) associated with respective transmissions conducted for one or more Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request (HARQ) 
processes. For example, for a HARQ process shared between distinct scheduling schemes, an NDI associated with a latter 
transmission can be regarded as toggled irrespective of the value of the NDI upon recognizing that a utilized scheduling scheme (e.g., 
as indicated via a radio network temporary identifier (RNTI) or the like) has changed between successive transmissions (e.g., from 
semi-persistent scheduling to dynamic scheduling), thereby allowing processing of the latter transmission as a transmission of new 
data. As additionally described herein, various techniques are described herein for NDI processing in the case of uplink grant and 
downlink assignment transmission
