(57) Abstract : 
A method and control system for controlling an engine during diesel particulate filter regeneration includes a diesel particulate filter 
(DPF) regeneration request module that generates a DPF regeneration request signal and an idle condition module that generates an 
idle condition signal when the engine is at an idle condition. A DPF regeneration control module initiates a timer in response to the 
DPF regeneration request signal and the idle condition signal. The DPF regeneration control module controls the engine oxygen level 
to a second level less than a first level corresponding to a non-idle speed level, and after a time period, controls the engine to generate 
oxygen at a third level greater than the second level.
