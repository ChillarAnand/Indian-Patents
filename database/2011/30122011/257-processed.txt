Abstract  =>  The invention provides an assembly comprising a cover and a device arranged fully or partly in the cover. The device comprises a first portion, and a second portion moveable relative to the first portion between an initial and an actuated position, and the cover comprises a cavity portion and a closure portion which together form an enclosure in which the device is arranged initially. Movement of the closure portion from an initial position in a first direction results in the second portion of the device being moved in a second direction between the initial and the actuated position, the first direction being different from the second direction. By this arrangement it is possible to provide a cover-device assembly which is easy and intuitive to use and open and at the same time ensures that the enclosed device is actuated correctly.
