Abstract  =>  A system and method for the destruction/ablation of stones, calculi or other hard substances by means of laser energy is disclosed. As a consequence, several important medical treatments can be performed, especially lithotripsy. The system comprises a diode laser source emitting at least at one wavelength, one or more optical fibers which convey laser radiation to the treatment site and a liquid delivery system used for creating a liquid environment around the stones (calculi). The laser device emits at least one wavelength which is highly absorbed in the surrounding/covering medium, thus causing evaporation and cavitation effects that lead to stone/calculi destruction. Different radiation configurations may be used. In one embodiment continuous radiation is used to create sparkler-less plasma bubbles able to destroy hard substances. In another embodiment high peak power pulsed radiation is used. Wavelengths of 1470 nm, 1940 nm, or 1550 nm are preferred.
