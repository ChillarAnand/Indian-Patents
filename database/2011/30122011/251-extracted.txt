(57) Abstract : 
The invention relates to a process for the preparation of metal nanoparticles, selected from the group consisting of lead, bismuth, zinc, 
antimony, indium, gold, nickel, cobalt, palladium, platinum, iridium, osmium, rhodium, ruthenium, rhenium, vanadium, chromium, 
manganese, niobium, molybdenum, tungsten, tantalum, cadmium, silver and/or copper, on a rotating body, characterized in that a 
reduction of corresponding metal salts, corresponding metal salt complexes, corresponding metal hydroxides and/or corresponding 
metal oxides by polyols having a number of hydroxyl groups in the polyol of 1 to 10 and a molecular weight of the polyols of 2000 to 
18 000 Da is effected.
