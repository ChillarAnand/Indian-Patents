Abstract  =>  The method of the invention comprises: a) determining (64, 68) at least one limit based on N already received identifiers, where N is strictly higher than the number of identifiers that can be contained in an anti-replay memory, the limit being determined so as to define, on the one hand, a range of identifiers that have not yet been received and, on the other hand, a range of identifiers containing the N already received identifiers; b) comparing (58) the newly received identifier to said limit; c) if the newly received identifier belongs to the range identifiers that have not yet been received, diagnosing (60) a first reception of the newly received identifier; and d) if the newly received identifier belongs to the range of identifiers containing the N already received identifiers, searching (73) the newly received identifier among those contained in the anti-replay memory.
