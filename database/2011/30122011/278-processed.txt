Abstract  =>  Controlling data flow through a data communications link, the link operating according to a data communications protocol in which a receiver of data communications on the link can suspend data communications on the link for a period of time determined by the receiver, including specifying for the sender a duration for flow control periods; specifying for the sender a number of corrupt communications control packets to be transmitted from the sender to the receiver during a flow control period; determining by the sender whether a flow control message is received from the receiver during a flow control period; altering, in dependence upon whether a flow control message is received from the receiver during a flow control period, the number of corrupt communications control packets; and transmitting, among normal data communications during a subsequent flow control period, the altered number of corrupt communications control packets from the sender to the receiver.
