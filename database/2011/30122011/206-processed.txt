Abstract  =>  This invention relates to a method and composition for treatment of a substrate. It particularly relates to a method and composition for treatment of a fabric substrate for imparting repellency of aqueous and oily soils. It is an object of the present invention is to provide a method of treating a substrate to render the substrate more hydrophobic and to provide repellence to both oily and aqueous soils and stains. It has been found that hydrophobicity and stain-resistance can be imparted to a substrate by contacting the substrate with soap and a water-soluble compound of trivalent or tetravalent metal in presence of water under specific range of pH, while the further addition of a quaternary silicone oil imparts oily soil repellence.
