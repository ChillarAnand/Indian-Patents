Abstract  =>  Memory devices and systems include a voltage sense line for addressing voltage tolerances across variable loadings. The memory devices and systems comprise a memory module connector with a first plurality of pins coupled to circuitry on a memory module, and a second plurality of pins coupled to power rails on the memory module that enable monitoring of the power rails from external to the memory module.
