(57) Abstract : 
A hydrogen generator of the present invention includes: a reformer (1) including a reforming catalyst (1A) containing nickel and 
configured to generate a hydrogen-rich fuel gas by using a raw material and steam; a temperature detector (12) configured to detect a 
temperature of the reforming catalyst (1A); a purge gas supplying device (7) configured to supply a purge gas to the reformer (1); and 
a controller (13). When the temperature detected by the temperature detector (12) is a first predetermined temperature or higher, the 
controller (13) purges the reformer (1) with the purge gas supplied from the purge gas supplying device (7).
