(57) Abstract : 
A data processing system facilitates organization of content such as digital photographs, video files, audio tracks, and the like. The 
data processing system comprises a content manager that manages a content database and includes a content database initialization or 
creation utility and a content database search utility. The a content database initialization utility creates a content database by 
assigning one or more tags that represents context of the content to content and combines the tag or tags with associated content in a 
data structure, and saves the data structure in a database. The content database search utility specifies a set of tag values representing 
context of content and initiates a database query for determining a set of content items that match the specified set of tag values. The 
content database search utility searches for the set of content items that match the tag values. [FIG. 1]
