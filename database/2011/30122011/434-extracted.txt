(57) Abstract : 
A vehicle light forms a low-beam light distribution pattern on a virtual plane having a horizontal line and a vertical line as reference 
lines, the low-beam light distribution pattern including at least a first partial light distribution pattern having a horizontal cut-off line 
and a second partial light distribution pattern having a cut-off line inclined by a predetermined angle with respect to the horizontal 
line. The vehicle light includes: an LED light source having an optical axis and disposed so that the optical axis thereof is directed in a 
horizontal direction; and a reflector being formed of a revolved paraboloid and having a first reflecting surface disposed on the optical 
axis of the LED light source so as to face to the LED light source and a second reflecting surface disposed outside of the first 
reflecting surface and at a farther position away from the light source than the first reflecting surface. The first reflecting surface is a 
revolved paraboloid as a whole, having a focus disposed near the LED light source so as to diffuse and reflect, in the horizontal 
direction, light emitted from the LED light source and reaching the first reflecting surface, thereby forming the first partial distribution 
pattern. The second reflecting surface is a revolved paraboloid as a whole, having a focus disposed near the LED light source so as to 
reflect light emitted from the LED light source and reaching the second reflecting surface and converge the light to an intersection of 
the horizontal line and the vertical line, thereby forming the second partial distribution pattern.
