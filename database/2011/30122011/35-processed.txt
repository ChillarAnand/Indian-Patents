Abstract  =>  A technology for the biodegradation of polyethylene by consortium of bacterial strains having accession numbers MTCC , MTCC and MTCC . The bacterial consortium synergistically brings about degradation of polyethylene. The process involves exposure of polyethylene strips cut and shredded in an inorganic nutrient medium containing the bacterial consortium capable of utilizing polyethylene as the sole source of carbon and energy. The process described in the embodiment facilitates the biodegradation of polyethylene in an eco-friendly, safe, efficient and cost effective manner.
