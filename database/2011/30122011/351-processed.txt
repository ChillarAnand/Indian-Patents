Abstract  =>  The present invention relates to a method for producing aqueous compatible nanoparticles. More particularly, the present invention provides a method for producing aqueous compatible semiconductor nanoparticles by binding pre- modified ligands to the nanoparticles without the need for further post-binding modification to render the nanoparticles aqueous compatible. Nanoparticles modified in this way can exhibit enhanced fluorescence and stability compared to aqueous compatible nanoparticles producing using prior art methods requiring post-binding modification processes.
