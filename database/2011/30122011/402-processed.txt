Abstract  =>  A method and apparatus of generating a ranging preamble code in a wireless communication system is provided. A mobile station (MS) generates one of a plurality of ranging preamble codes, wherein the plurality of ranging preamble codes are based on a padded Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequence to which a cyclic shift is applied in a unit of HCS, where NCS is a function of a cyclic prefix (CP) length in a time domain.
