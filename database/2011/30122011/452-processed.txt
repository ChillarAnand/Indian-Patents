Abstract  =>  Screen assemblies capable of being disposed in a wellbore for hydrocarbon fluid production are described. The screen assemblies can support tubes for receiving hydrocarbon fluid and reduce or eliminate plugging of the tubes by swellable material. A screen assembly may include a support material between a tube and swellable material located exterior to a base pipe. The tube may include perforations and can receive and direct hydrocarbon fluids from the formation. The swellable material can expand after contact with an activating fluid and can displace the tube toward a surface of the bore. The swellable material can expand more than the support material and the support material can reduce or prevent plugging of the perforations by the swellable material expanding.
