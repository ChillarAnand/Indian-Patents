Abstract  =>  A method (300) for discovering a route between a source node and a destination node in mesh wireless media (WiMedia) based networks. The method comprises upon receiving a route request (RREQ) by an intermediate node between the source node and the destination node, saving, in the RREQ, at least the identification (ID) number of the intermediate node and a transmission channel rate of a link on which the RREQ is received on(S320); computing a new route price (S330); determining if the new route price is larger than a price included in the received RREQ (S340); updating the received RREQ to include the new route price when the new route price is larger than the route price in the received RREQ (S350); and forwarding the updated RREQ to one or more neighbors of the intermediate node (S370).
