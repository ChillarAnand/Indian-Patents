(57) Abstract : 
There is provided a vehicle wheel 5 where an outer circumferential shape of a cross section of a rimportion 3 is formed into a circle 
having a predetermined diameter by subjecting a wheel precursor 1 obtained by casting using a side gate type wheel casting mold 
having two gates symmetrical to a wheel axis to spinning uniformly over the entire circumference of the rim portion 3 of the wheel 
precursor 1. The wheel precursor 1 has a shape where the rim portion 3 has a thickness gradually reducing from gate-corresponding 
sections 3a which correspond with the gates toward 90° shift sections 3b which are sections of 90° shift in a circumferential direction 
from the gate-corresponding sections 3a to make a deformation ratio of the gate-corresponding sections 3a higher than that of the 90° 
shift sections 3b by subjecting the wheel precursor 1 to the spinning.
