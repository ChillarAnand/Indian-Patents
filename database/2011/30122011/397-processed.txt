Abstract  =>  A method of opening a cigarette cover and an assembly for opening cigarette covers in a machine for recovering tobacco from defective and/or substandard cigarette are disclosed. The method involves cutting open the cigarette transported in a feeder guiding groove of a machine for recovering tobacco from defective and/or substandard cigarettes, the cigarette being cut with at least one revolving disc knife located above the feeder, in which the at least one revolving disc knife is applied to the cigarette in such a way that the axis on which the said disc knife is perpendicularly mounted lies in a plane parallel to the plane in which the cigarette axis is being translated; the disc knife plane does not comprise the cigarette axis and is parallel to the said cigarette axis; rotation of the cigarette around its axis in the guiding groove is being blocked; whereby tensile stress is being caused in the cigarette cover facilitating its opening.
