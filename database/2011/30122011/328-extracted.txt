(57) Abstract : 
Systems and methodologies are described that facilitate dynamically forming clusters in a wireless communication environment. A set 
of non-overlapping clusters can be formed dynamically over time and in a distributed manner. Each of the clusters can include a set of 
base stations and a set of mobile devices. The clusters can be yielded based upon a set of local strategies selected by base stations 
across the network converged upon through message passing. For example, each base station can select a particular local strategy as a 
function of time based upon network-wide utility estimates respectively conditioned upon implementation of the particular local 
strategy and disparate possible local strategies that can cover the corresponding base station. Moreover, operation within each of the 
clusters can be coordinated.
