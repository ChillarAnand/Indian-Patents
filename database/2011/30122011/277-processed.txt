Abstract  =>  A method (200) for enabling compatibility of wireless devices having different regulation settings. The method comprises upon initialization of a wireless device, scanning a predefined common channel (S220); forming a WiNet service set (WSS) by wireless devices communicating over the predefined common channel (S230); upon switching of the wireless devices in the WSS to a channel other than the predefined common channel, checking if a new wireless device attempts to join the WSS (S240, S250); and adding the new wireless device to the WSS if such attempt was detected (S290).
