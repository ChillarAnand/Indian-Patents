(57) Abstract : 
This invention proposes a novel charging method for improving the efficiency of charging a super capacitor. The method comprises 
the steps of: charging the super capacitor with a first current; measuring a voltage of the super capacitor; stopping the supply of the 
first current when the measured voltage reaches a pre-defined voltage value; monitoring a voltage variation of the super capacitor; 
charging the super capacitor with a second current when the monitored voltage variation exceeds a pre-defined threshold within a pre-
defined period. By using said two-phase charging, especially when using two different charging currents, it is easier to improve the 
charging efficiency without degrading the charging speed. Fig.3
