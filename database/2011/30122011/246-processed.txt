Abstract  =>  The disclosure pertains to a method for making a nanoscale field effect transistor structure on a semiconductor substrate (120). The method comprises disposing a mask on a semiconductor upper layer (122) of a multi-layer substrate, and removing areas of the upper layer (122) not covered by the mask in a nanowire lithography process. The mask includes two conductive terminals (132, 134) separated by a distance, and a nanowire (110) in contact with the conductive terminals (132, 134) across the distance. The nanowire lithography may be carried out using a deep-reactive-ion-etching, which results in an integration of the nanowire mask (1 10, 132, 134) and the underlying semiconductor layer (122) to form a nanoscale semiconductor channel for the field effect transistor.
