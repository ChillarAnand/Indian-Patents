Abstract  =>  An audio system receives a multi-channel signal which is fed to a controller (121) that generates a first drive signal for a first sound emitter (111) by combining signals of a plurality of the channels. The first drive signal has a signal component contribution from a first bandwidth of each channel of the multi-channel signal. The multi-channel signal is also fed to another controller (115) which generates second drive signals for second sound emitters (101-109). The second drive signals are generated from a single channel signals of the multi-channel signal and in a second bandwidth having a lower cut-off frequency which is above 950Hz for a 3dB gain attenuation relative to an average gain for a frequency band extending 1kHz above the lower cut-off frequency and higher than a lower cut-off frequency of the first bandwidth.
