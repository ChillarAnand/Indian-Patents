(57) Abstract : 
A plurality of identical plates (10), each having a number of parallel, vertical slits (30, 32), are arranged side by side and are spaced by 
assembly means (24, 26, 28). Rigid boards (34, 36) are inserted through the vertical slits to define rectangular wells for holding the 
boxed articles in a stacked arrangement. Rest ledges (40, 70) are arranged at staggered heights below each well, in order to prevent the 
articles held in the wells from dropping out, while allowing them to be horizontally withdrawn at the bottom one at a time. The rest 
ledges may be slats (40) inserted through horizontal slits (38) in the plates (10) at staggered heights, or tabs (70) laterally projecting at 
right angles from the bottom edge of each plate.
