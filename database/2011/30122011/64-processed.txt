Abstract  =>  The present invention provides an improved modular plastic formwork panel (10, 30) and its construction support accessory (70), which is simple, light-weight, high reliability and strong enough to withstand the pressure caused by expansion of setting concrete, of poured concrete, or other forces, and reduce pillowing of the formwork. A new, re-usable modular plastic formwork (10, 30) with reinforced ribs (18) and reinforced groove (22) has been developed to resist pillowing on face sheet and deflection on side edges without substantial additional weight and manufacturing cost. Moreover, the modular plastic formwork panel (10, 30) is non-adhesive or non-stick to concrete. It provides a favorable/smooth surface finish to wall when concrete is cured. No further secondary processes, such as surface cleaning and maintenance are required to the formwork panel. It eliminates the use of release agent to the formwork panel and thus, reduces operation cost as well as maintenance cost. The present invention also provides a construction support accessory (70) enables the formworks serve for casting in place and it can be quickly put in place prior to pour of wet concrete. The construction support accessory can be quickly removed in re-usable condition after concrete is cure.
