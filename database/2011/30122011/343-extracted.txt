(57) Abstract : 
The present invention is related to a process for providing an assembly of cell microcarriers, comprising the steps of providing planar, 
two-dimensional objects having two sides (flakes), wherein these objects comprise a material which, upon application of an extrinsic 
stimulus, is transferred from the planar state into a rolled state, providing cells on one side of said flakes (cell-bearing side), 
transferring the flakes from the planar state into a rolled state (cell wrap) by application of said extrinsic stimulus, and coupling at 
least one type of binding agent to the flakes (Fig. 2)
