(57) Abstract : 
An alignment film (100) according to the present invention includes: a first alignment layer (102) containing a first polyimide (p1); 
and a second alignment layer (104) containing a polymerization product (po) resulting from polymerization of a polyfunctional 
monomer and a second polyimide (p2). The polyfunctional monomer is represented by general formula (1) P1-A1-(Z1-A2)n-P2 (in 
general formula (1), P1 and P2 each independently of the other are an acrylate, methacrylate, acrylamide, methacrylamide, vinyl, 
vinyloxy, or epoxy group; A1 and A2 each independently of the other represent a 1,4-phenylene, 1,4-cyclohexane, 2,5-thiophene, or 
naphthalene-2,6-diyl group; Z1 is a -COO- group, a -OCO- group, a -O- group, a -CONH- group or a single bond, where n is 0, 1, or 
2).
