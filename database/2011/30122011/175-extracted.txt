Methods and apparatuses are directed to calibrating a misconfigured wireless access point. One method may include receiving a 
position of mobile station(s) and wireless signal model measurements derived from packets exchanged between the mobile station(s) 
and a plurality of wireless access points, receiving positions and/or identities of the plurality of wireless access points used in 
determining the position of the mobile station(s), comparing a position of the mobile station(s) with wireless signal model 
measurements, and identifying a misconfigured wireless access point based upon the comparing. Another method may include 
receiving positions associated with a plurality of wireless access points, determining a position of a mobile station based upon a 
wireless signal model, comparing the position of the mobile station and the wireless signal model with the positions associated with 
the plurality of wireless access points, and determining whether at least one wireless access point is misconfigured.
