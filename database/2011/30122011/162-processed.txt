Abstract  =>  Image processing methods and systems are disclosed. In a particular embodiment, a method is disclosed that includes receiving image data. The image data includes color component data representing a location of a pixel in a color space. The method further includes performing a linear transformation of the location of the pixel in the color space when the location is identified as within a skin color region of the color space. The linear transformation is performed by mapping the location of the pixel at a first portion of the skin color region to a second portion of the skin color region based on a position of the pixel within the skin color region and based on the proximity of the position of the pixel to a boundary of the skin color region. The color space remains substantially continuous at the boundary of the skin color region after applying the linear transformation.
