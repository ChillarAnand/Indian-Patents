Abstract  =>  A plug connector (1) having an insulating material housing (2) which has at least one contact pin insertion opening (8) on a first housing face (7) for the insertion of electrically conductive contact pins (15), and has at least one conductor insertion opening (6) on a second housing face (5) for the insertion of stripped ends (14) of electrical conductors (13) is described. A pair comprising a contact pin insertion opening (8) and a conductor insertion opening (6) in each case has a common associated conductor connecting area. The conductor insertion opening (6) opens into a conductor connecting area (4), and the contact pin insertion opening (8) has a passage (9) to the conductor connecting area (4). Furthermore, the plug connector in each case has one spring force terminal connection in an associated conductor connecting area (4) with a spring element (3) which has a clamping section (12), which can be moved by spring force transversely with respect to the extent direction of a pair comprising a contact pin insertion opening (8) and a conductor insertion opening (6), such that, when a stripped end (14) of an electrical conductor (13) is inserted into the conductor insertion opening (6), the stripped end (14) is pushed in the direction of the contact pin insertion opening (8). The at least one contact pin insertion opening (8) has a width (B1) of the passage (9) over a length in its extent direction, which is aligned from the first housing face (7) to the second housing face (5), at least in the area above the clamping section (12) in the direction of the second housing face (5) and under the clamping section (12) in the direction of the first housing face (7), which width (B1) is less than the width (B2) between the mutually opposite side walls of the conductor connecting area (4) adjacent to the transition to the contact pin insertion opening (8).
