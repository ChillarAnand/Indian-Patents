Abstract  =>  Methods and systems for parsing and decoding compressed data are provided. Random segments of the compressed data may be decompressed and positioned appropriately in the corresponding uncompressed data set. The methods and systems utilize variable to fixed length (VF) coding techniques. For some applications, the VF coding techniques may be implemented within media encoders, decoders, or combined encoder-decoders (CODECs).
