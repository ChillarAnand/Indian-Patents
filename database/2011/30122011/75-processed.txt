Abstract  =>  A process of maintaining compression on a media bed in a chromatography system said process comprising the steps of: using said load cell to measure said force exerted on said adjustable bed support; using said sensor to measure the pressure of said fluid; calculating compression force on said media bed, based on measurements from said load cell and said sensor; comparing said calculated compression force to an optimal compression force; and using said actuator to move said adjustable bed support based on said comparison.
