Abstract  =>  This invention relates to the field of pharmaceutical/process chemistry. Disclosed herein is a process for preparing N4- (2 2- dimethyl-4- [ (dihydrogen phosphonoxy) methyl] -3-oxo-5-pyrido [1 4] oxazin-6-yl) -5fluoro-N2- (3 4 5-trimethox yphenyl) -2 4-pyrimidinediamine disodium salt particularly hydrates (such as a hexahydrate). The compound is useful in the treatment and prevention of various diseases. Also disclosed is a process of preparing N4- (2 2-dimethyl-4- [ (dialkyl phosphonoxy) methyl] -3- oxo-5-pyrido [1 4] oxazin-6-yl) -5-f luoro-N2- (3 4 5-trimethox yphenyl ) -2 4-pyrimidinediamine. Both processes involve the use of an amide. in.
