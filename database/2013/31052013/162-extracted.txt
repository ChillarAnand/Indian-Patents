(57) Abstract :
Highly productive D-lactic acid fermentation is achieved by using a transformant obtained by introducing into a host cell a
polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide according to any one of the following (A) to (C) in such a manner that the polypeptide is
expressed, which polypeptide has a D-lactate dehydrogenase activity higher than those of conventional polypeptides: (A) a
polypeptide having the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 1 or 2; (B) a polypeptide having the same amino acid
sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO: 1 or 2 except that one or several amino acids are substituted, deleted, inserted and/or added,
which polypeptide has a D-lactate dehydrogenase activity; and (C) a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence which has a
sequence identity of not less than 80% to the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 1 or 2, which polypeptide has a D-
lactate dehydrogenase activity.
