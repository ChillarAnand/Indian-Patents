Abstract  =>  Nanocomposite materials having at least two layers, each layer consisting of one metal oxide bonded to at least one grapheme layer were developed. The nanocomposite materials will typically have many alternating layers of metal oxides and grapheme layers, bonded in a sandwich type construction and will be incorporated into an electro-chemical or energy storage device.
