Abstract  =>  Systems and methods may provide for determining an absolute energy break-even time for a first low power state with respect to a current state of a system. A relative energy break-even time may also be determined for the first low power state with respect to a second low power state based on at least in part the absolute energy break-even time. In additibn, an operating state may be selected for the system based on at least in part the relative energy break-even time.
