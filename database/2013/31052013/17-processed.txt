Abstract  =>  The Invention relates to a process of improving digestibility and nutritive value of a lignocellulosic animal feed. The process comprises fermenting wheat straw by a basidiomycetous fungi, which would lead to the production of highly digestible and nutritive ruminant feed. The invention discloses a method to produce nutritively rich ruminant feed using quick colonizing basidiomycetous fungus. The fermented feed produced hereby is nontoxic and has improved palatability and nutrient digestibility.
