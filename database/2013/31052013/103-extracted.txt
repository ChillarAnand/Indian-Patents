(57) Abstract :
A flip-flop includes: a first (P), second (N), third (P), and fourth (N) transistors; input terminals; and first and second output
terminals, the first and second transistors constituting a first CMOS circuit such that gate terminals are connected and drain
terminals are connected, the third and fourth transistors constituting a second CMOS circuit such that gate terminals are connected
and drain terminals are connected, the first output terminal connected to a gate side of the first CMOS circuit and a drain side of
the second CMOS circuit, the second output terminal connected to a gate side of the second CMOS circuit and a drain side of the
first CMOS circuit, at least one input transistor included in the group of the first through fourth transistors, a source terminal of the
input transistor being connected to one of the input terminals. This can provide a further compact flip-flop.
