Abstract  =>  Described herein is a Slotted Holes Mesh- Filtered Steel Pile that can be used in a variety of soil conditions as well as apparatus and associated methods. Slotted holes helps in increase of effective stresses in soil-steel pile surface interaction by draining out extra buildup of pore water pressure in the immediate and longer run of time. As the potential flow of water will not be outwards but inwards to inside of steel pile through slotted holes of steel pile. It relieves of chances of buildup of excess pore water pressure for liquefaction of soils in the radially stressed zones of interaction of soil-steel pile. As effective stresses are directly proportional to shear strength of the soil mass, thereby, it will lead to increase of side-resistance on soil-steel pile surfaces. The side-resistance which is a part of load carrying capacity of steel piles will be increased to a large extent due to increase of effective stresses on soil-steel pile interface. This will be further increased due to presence of slotted holes on the outer lateral surface of the steel pile which not only drains out pore water to inside of the steel pile through mesh filter but also increase frictional forces due to roughness of the surface. In totality, it leads to increase in load carrying capacity of the pile, increase in the density of adjoining soil mass, consolidation of the soft soil and improved safety factor for designed loads of super-structures. The dewatering unit attached through a pipe from the top-most slotted hole of the steel pile shall act to remove the drained out water collected in-side the slotted hole steel pile. This special feature of slotted hole is provided throughout the vertical wall to accelerate the drainage in the entire zone of influence. A fine wire mesh of a designed sieve size is placed inside the slotted steel pile.
