Abstract  =>  The present invention describes the preparation of fatty imidazolines using a facile, rapid and environmentally green microwave assisted reaction. The imidazolines were prepared using fatty acids like octyl, dodecyl, tetradecyl and octadecyl acids; mixed fatty acids prepared from Sterculia foetida oil (containing cyclopropene-rich fatty acids), coconut oil (containing medium chain-rich fatty acids), sunflower oil (containing unsaturated-rich fatty acids) and palm oil (containing saturated-rich fatty acids) by reacting with diethylene triamine (DETA) in the presence of calcium oxide. Fatty imidazolines were evaluated for anti-microbial activity and exhibited good to excellent anti-Candida activity against different Candida strains as compared to Fluconazole as standard. The fatty imidazolines also exhibited excellent to moderate anti-bacterial activity. Imidazolines were also evaluated for anti- cancer activity against different cancer cell lines like HeLa, A549, MDA-MB-231, MCF7 and Neuro2a which showed excellent cytotoxicity for dodecyl, tetradecyl and coco-based imidazolines followed by Sterculia foetida fatty imidazolines. Palm oil exhibited activity towards A549, HeLa and MCF-7, while sunflower oil towards A549 and Neuro2a.
