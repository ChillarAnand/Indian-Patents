At least some of the fields are evaluated in order to identify nouns and noun phrases within the fields. The method also includes identifying selected words within the nouns and noun phrases based on a white list and a blacklist. The white list includes a plurality of designated words to be tagged and the blacklist includes a plurality of rejected words that are not to be tagged. A resultant composite is generated for the selected nouns and noun phrases that are tagged. The resultant composite is incorporated into the white list if the resultant composite is approved.
