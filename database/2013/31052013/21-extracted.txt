(57) Abstract :
Present invention revolves around the problem definition RFID Based Vehicle Identification and Access Control into parking,
providing automated identification of vehicles using RFID system. It also provides an access control mechanism for the parking
area by authorizing the vehicles using the RFID tags. The UID of the RFID tag will be stored in the database and will fetched
every time the vehicle comes or wishes to come into the parking area. If the UID matches with the one stored against the vehicle
information stored into the database, the vehicle will get an access into the parking area. We will also provide business
intelligence tools such as Report Generation for making management decisions. Such reports may be used for further planning. In
such way a complete Parking Identification System is proposed in the problem definition. Following invention is described in
detail with the help of Figure 1 of sheet 1 showing Vehicle Check-in flowchart describing the check-in process, Figure 2 of sheet
2 showing Vehicle Check-in flowchart describing the check-in process, Figure 3 of sheet 3 showing Vehicle approaching the
RFID reader antenna, Figure 4 of sheet 3 showing RFID antenna detecting the tag, Figure 5 of sheet 4 showing Vehicle Check-out
flowchart describing the check-out process, Figure 6 of sheet 5 showing breakdown structure of the invention.
