(57) Abstract :
The present invention relates to a method for physical plant treatment by means of electrostatic charge, wherein a transfer of the
electrostatic charge takes place via water treated by means of an influencing method, wherein the water comprises water clusters
having an electron deficit due to the treatment by means of an influencing method, wherein the water treated by means of an
influencing method can be obtained by the following process steps: introducing the water to be treated into a galvanic element,
aligning the charges and free electrons in the electrical field, separating the charges by motion and the influence resulting
therefrom, and collecting and removing the de-electronized, positively charged fraction. The method for physical plant treatment
allows comprehensive and effective treatment of fungal diseases, simultaneously avoiding toxicological loads on the environment.
