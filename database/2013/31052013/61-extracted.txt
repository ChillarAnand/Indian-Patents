(57) Abstract :
The present invention automatically extracts, to a maximum extent, reliability-relevant information from a Substation
Configuration Description (SCD) file describing a electric power transmission or distribution substation. In particular, the
information present in the SCD file is used to identify the physical topology of a communication network of the Substation
Automation (SA) system, as well as all dataflow relating to a given SA functionality or Logical Node (LN). An LN reliability
measure for the latter is calculated, involving reliability indications specific to each element or device participating in said
dataflow. Finally, a number of LN reliability measures are consolidated to produce an overall reliability for the SA system
architecture or communication network topology considered. The proposed invention minimizes the engineering effort required to
perform a reliability calculation, and thus allows comparing the reliability of different SA architectures with minimal effort and
intervention of a reliability engineer.
