There is a bucket / container for containing water along with a fixture for placing the mop when not in use. To use, the mop is dipped in water, taken out and rested on the fixture for less than 1 minute to drain out the excess water. It is then put on the floor in such a way that the entire mop cloth is spread on the floor and used to clean every nook and corner of the floor by maneuvering the handle, which can move 180 degrees - 90 degrees on each side. In the whole exercise, the user has not used hands or external device to wring dry the mop cloth and the entire operation is performed very fast and with least effort.
