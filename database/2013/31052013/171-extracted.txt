(57) Abstract :
Brominated and epoxidized organic compounds are useful flame retardants for polymers such as polystyrene. The organic
compounds contain both bromine and oxirane groups and have molecular weights of at least 1500. The brominated and
epoxidized organic compounds can be prepared by sequentially brominating and epoxiding (in either order) a starting compound
that contains multiple non-conjugated carbon-carbon double bonds.
