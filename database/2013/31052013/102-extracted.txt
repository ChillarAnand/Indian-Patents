(57) Abstract :
A communication terminal is capable of simultaneously communicating through a plurality of carriers by carrier aggregation and
the communication terminal comprises: a quality measurement unit for measuring the reception quality of a radio wave
transmitted through a plurality of carriers from a base station of a connected cell to obtain a measured value; a primary carrier
storage unit storing information specifying a primary carrier chosen from the plurality of carriers; a comparator for comparing a
measured value of the primary carrier measured by the quality measurement unit to a threshold value; and a cell search unit for
searching for another cell when the measured value of the primary carrier is less than or equal to the threshold value.
Consequently a search threshold value for carrier aggregation can be appropriately determined to perform a cell search and a
quality measurement.
