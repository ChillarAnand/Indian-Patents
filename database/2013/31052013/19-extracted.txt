(57) Abstract :
A system (100) for generating electricity. The system includes an electric motor (106), which is connected to a hydraulic pump
(110). The hydraulic pump (110), receives oil from an oil reservoir (104), and thereupon, pressurises the oil. The pressurised oil is
fed to a hydraulic cylinder (114) through pipes (108). The pressurised oil imparts liner motion to the piston of the hydraulic
cylinder (114). The liner motion is converted into rotary motion by the mechanical linkages connected to the end of the piston rod.
The rotary motion is fed to the electric generator (118) to generate electricity, after stepping up the rotation using a step up
gearbox (116).
