(57) Abstract :
Systems and methodologies are described herein that facilitate resolution between respective radios associated with a multi-radio
wireless device. As described herein various techniques can be utilized with a multi-radio coexistence manager and/or other
suitable mechanisms associated with a wireless device to perform joint resolution for multiple associated radios thereby providing
performance enhancements over conventional piecewise radio resolution schemes. Various exhaustive decoupled and
progressive radio resolution algorithms are provided herein by which respective sets of parameters (e.g. transmit powers
interference targets frequency sub-bands radio frequency knob settings etc.) can be selected for respective potentially conflicting
radios to enable such radios to operate in coexistence. Further techniques are provided herein for utilizing a graph theoretic
algorithm for progressive radio resolution. In addition a generic power resolution algorithm can be modified to provide support
for multi-transmitter interference mechanisms by employing modifications such as joint power resolution and/or one-pass or
iterative interference partitioning.
