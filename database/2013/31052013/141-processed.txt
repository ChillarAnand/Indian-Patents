Abstract  =>  The invention discloses a method for dynamically adjusting pre-emphasis and equalization parameters of chips and a device thereof, wherein the device includes: a mapping relationship creating module, an adjusted information obtaining module and a parameter calculating module; the dynamic adjustment method comprises: the mapping relationship creating module creating an element mapping relationship table; when the plug-in board information in an optical transmission device is adjusted, the adjusted information obtaining module obtaining adjusted information and reporting to the parameter calculating module; the parameter calculating module firstly recalculating a total length of transmission lines between interconnected cards according to the adjusted plug-in board information and the element mapping relationship table, and then recalculating pre-emphasis and equalization parameter values according to the total length of transmission lines and chip types of the interconnected cards, and notifying the pre-emphasis and equalization parameter values to a master control board, which then issues the pre-emphasis and equalization parameter values to each card. By using the invention, the master control board can dynamically adjust pre-emphasis and equalization parameters and notify them to each card timely, which ensures that each card can adjust message signals according to the adjusted pre-emphasis and equalization parameters, thereby improving transmission quality of message signals.
