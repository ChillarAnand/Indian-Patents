(57) Abstract :
A mobile communication method according to the present invention comprising a step A in which, when a predetermined trigger
is detected, the radio base station DeNB notifies the relay node RN of a transmission timing of an MBSFN subframe by a signal
for changing the configuration of an RRC connection that is set between the radio base station DeNB and the relay node RN, a
step B in which the radio base station DeNB performs scheduling such that a downlink signal is transmitted to the relay node RN
at the transmission timing of the MBSFN subframe, and a step G in which the relay node RN performs scheduling such that a
downlink signal is transmitted at a timing other than the transmission timing of the MBSFN subframe.
