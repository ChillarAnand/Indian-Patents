(57) Abstract :
A method and a system for diagnosing an apparatus are provided. The method for diagnosing the apparatus comprises:
determining whether the apparatus is to enter a diagnostic mode after a system is started; performing a diagnosis of the apparatus
by executing a diagnostic program when the apparatus is determined to enter the diagnostic mode; and performing a normal BIOS
or EFI startup when the apparatus is determined not to enter the diagnostic mode. An accurate diagnosis of the apparatus can be
realized by firstly determining whether the apparatus is to enter a diagnostic mode after a system is started, if yes, then the
apparatus entering the diagnostic mode, and if not, then the apparatus performing a normal BIOS or EFI startup. Moreover, in case
of a memory or PCI/PCIB bus error in the apparatus, since the diagnostic program is loaded prior to the BIOS startup, the fault
can be diagnosed.
