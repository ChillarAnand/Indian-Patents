Abstract  =>  The present disclosure relates to management of security associations over a communication network particularly in an IPSEC protocol. Some embodiments of the present disclosure illustrate a system for managing security associations over a communication network. Such a system comprises a session allocation unit and a plurality of session processing units coupled to the session allocation unit. The session allocation unit may be configured to allocate an incoming IKE/data packet to one of the session processing unit based on current processing load at initiation of a session and to a previously allocated session processing unit for a continuing session. The session allocation unit may be configured further to identify the previously allocated session processing unit using a session processing index contained in the incoming lKE/data packet.
