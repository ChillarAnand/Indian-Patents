(57) Abstract :
Flip-flops and latches are indispensable components of modern digital systems.Flip-flops and latches along with the clock
network account for 30-70% of the total system power dissipation. Flip-flops also determine the highest operating speed of any
synchronous digital system driven by clock. Hence there is always a need for high performance and low power flip flop designs
implemented with minimum number of transistors to save chip area.
