(57) Abstract :
A method device and system for transmitting channel state information (CSI) are provided which belong to the field of
communications and solve the problem that it is difficult to transmit CSI information in a cooperative multiple-input multiple-
output (MIMO) system in the prior art. The technical solution provided in the invention includes: obtaining the channel state
information between a mobile terminal and more than two cooperative base stations; according to a preset single cell code book
between the mobile terminal and each base station of the more than two cooperative base stations respectively quantifying the
channel state information and obtaining a combined codeword index of the quantified channel state information in the single cell
code book; transmitting the combined codeword index of the quantified channel state information in the single cell code book.
The implements in the present invention can be applied in the cooperative MIMO system.
