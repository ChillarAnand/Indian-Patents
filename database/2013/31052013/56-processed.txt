Abstract  =>  Embodiments of this invention relate generally to high temperature thermal energy storage, and more specifically, to the use of the latent heat of fusion of melting and solidifying metals to receive from and provide heat to a gaseous medium. Embodiments of this invention are also known as the Liquid Metal Thermal Storage system or LIMETS. Also described are methods of containing the storage material, heat transfer means, and choices of metals and alloys for thermal storage materials.
