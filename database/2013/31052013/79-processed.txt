Abstract  =>  A needle set for use in a biopsy device where the needle set includes a plurality of annularly nested cannulae. Each of the cannulae have a distal end a proximal end a lumen and a cannula body. At least two of the cannulae are joined at their proximal ends. The distal ends of the two joined cannulae are mountable in a biopsy device. At least one of the two joined cannulae further have at least two flexible linkages joining the cannula body to its proximal end. Upon rotating the cannula body around its longitudinal axis while fixing the proximal end the linkages present therebetween will contact one another effectively cutting the luminal space between the cannula body and the proximal end of the cannula thereby also cutting any material for example biopsy material present in the lumen.
