(57) Abstract :
The present invention generally relates to method of preparing proniosomal gel. More particularly, it relates to preparation of
proniosomal gel of standardised Withania somnifera leaves extract, for better bioavailability, anti-inflammatory activity, to be
used as transdermal application. To obtain this gel, the leaves extract of Withania somnifera is incorporated along with and like
other components of the proniosomal gel by coacervation phase separation method. This method directly gives gel form of
Proniosomes, hence preferable over other tedious methods of proniosomal gel preparation in which the Proniosomes are first
prepared and then incorporated into some suitable gel base.
