Abstract  =>  A traffic amount calculation portion calculates a traffic amount caused by transmission signals received by a transmission signal reception portion. An average traffic amount calculation portion calculates an average traffic amount that is an average of the traffic amount in a nearest predetermined interval. Further, a modulation method setting portion changes a modulation method used by a modulation portion based on the calculated average traffic amount In addition, a transmission portion transmits transmission signals by using a transmission power amount corresponding to the modulation method used by the modulation portion.
