Abstract  =>  Disclosed is a composition comprising a charged particle of volume 5 nm3 to 50 million nm3 preferably having an inorganic core of SiO2, AI2O3, and/or TiO2, or a core essentially consisting of an organic pigment and/or pigment derivative, and a counter ion which is separable from the particle and is not covalently linked to the particle, said counter ion comprising a silicon atom which is directly bound to a carbon atom. Preferably, said charged particle comprises a dye attached to said inorganic core and said counter ion comprises a (poly)siloxane moiety linked via suitable bridge members to a quaternary, positively charged, nitrogen or phosphorus atom, or to a moiety carrying an anionic functional group. Said composition may be used e.g. in the form of a homogenous dispersion in an electrophoretic display.
