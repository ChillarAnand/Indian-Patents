(57) Abstract :
A solution for analyzing a body-part of a patient is proposed. A corresponding data-processing method (A1-A14) includes the
steps of providing (A1) a sequence of input images representing the body-part over an analysis period each input image including
a set of input values each one being indicative of a response to an interrogation signal of a corresponding location of the body-part
at a corresponding acquisition instant included in the analysis period associating (A2 A3 A4 A6) an analysis function of time with
each one of a set of selected locations the analysis function modeling a trend of the input values of the selected location in the
sequence of input images and providing (A2™ A4™ A5 A6™) a reference function of time for the analysis functions; in the
solution according to an embodiment of the invention the data-processing method further includes comparing (A7) the analysis
function of each selected location with the reference function
