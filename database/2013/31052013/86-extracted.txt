(57) Abstract :
A system is described for relative positioning of access points in a real time locating system. The system may include a memory
interface and processorThe memory may store layout information for a work area which includes architectural and infrastructure
attributesThe processor may determine a number of access points to position in the work area based on the architectural
attributeThe processor may determine a placement of a test tag in the work area based on the infrastructure ttributesThe processor
may determine a positioning of the access points in the work area which substantially maximizes coverage and accuracy of
locating the test tag in the work area. The processor may determine a repositioning of one of the access points when the coverage
and accuracy do not satisfy a thresholdThe processor may provide a graphical representation of the positioning of the access
points when the threshold is satisfied.
