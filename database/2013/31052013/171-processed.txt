Abstract  =>  Brominated and epoxidized organic compounds are useful flame retardants for polymers such as polystyrene. The organic compounds contain both bromine and oxirane groups and have molecular weights of at least 1500. The brominated and epoxidized organic compounds can be prepared by sequentially brominating and epoxiding (in either order) a starting compound that contains multiple non-conjugated carbon-carbon double bonds.
