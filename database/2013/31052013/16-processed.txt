Abstract  =>  This invention discloses a unique concept of swash plate type compressor (both single acting and double acting designs) which has the innovative feature Cylinder Bores having multiple axial taper Oil Separation Grooves near the bottom dead center (BDC) of piston operation in the cylinder blocks, which are equi-spaced annularly. The oil is get collected due to Surface tension, Viscous Force & Capillary action into the grooves and groove parameters are optimized (Groove depth, Groove taper angle and groove length) with Optimum Differential pressure to push the collected oil in the grooves to swash chamber with minimum most refrigerant gas blow-by. In a preferred embodiment the cylinder blocks are made up of metallic materials (Aluminium, Cast-iron, Steel) etc...(by forging, machining, casting, molding) or Non-metallic materials like PTFE, PEEK , PPS through injection molding process. In overall the Coefficient of Performance (COP) of the Compressor and the entire Air-Conditioning systems consist of Compressor, Condenser, Valve expansion , evaporator with or without Internal heat Exchanger (IHX) connected back to compressor in the sequence written is improved by this new invention. The salient features of our invention are using Cylinder bores having multiple axial taper Oil Separation Grooves near the bottom dead center (BDC) of piston operation in the cylinder blocks, which are equi-spaced annularly in swash plate and wobble plate type compressors for the cooling capacity range from 0.5 kW to 50 kW for Automotive and Non-Automotive Air-Conditioning and Refrigeration applications with fixed and variable displacement Designs with multiple single acting and double acting Pistons.
