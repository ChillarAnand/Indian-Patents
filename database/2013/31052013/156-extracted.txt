(57) Abstract :
An apparatus comprising storage tor a secret key, said secret key for use in the generation of cryptographic values, and a
cryptographic agent for generating said cryptographic values using said secret key, selects one of a predetermined set of key
transformations in an unpredictable-way and applies said selected key transformation to said secret key prior to generating one of
said cryptographic values A server receives and authenticates a credential generated using a transformed secret and derives the
transformed secret, by generating a plurality of verification values using a set of known permitted transformations of a stored
secret, determining whether said credential matches one of said plurality of verification values, and, if said credential matches one
of said plurality of verification values, storing the corresponding one of said set of known permitted transformations as an updated
value for said stored secret.
