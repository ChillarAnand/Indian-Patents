(57) Abstract :
An electromagnetic clutch includes a rotatable input member and a rotatable output member. A clutch plate is fixed for rotation
with one of the input member and the output member. An armature plate is axially moveable relative to the other of the input
member and the output member. A self-energizing actuator converts rotary motion of the input member to linear movement of the
armature plate. The actuator includes a biasing member urging relative rotation between the one of the input member and the
output member and the armature plate to initially engage the armature plate and the clutch plate. The self-energizing actuator
provides an additional clutch engagement force once the input member is driven and also includes an electromagnet to axially
translate the armature plate and disengage the armature plate and the clutch plate.
