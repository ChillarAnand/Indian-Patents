(57) Abstract :
A device for expressing human breast milk has a breast shield (4) for bearing against a mother's breast, a vacuum pump (1) for
generating a vacuum, a line which connects the vacuum pump (1) to the breast shield (4) and is intended for transmitting the
vacuum generated to the breast shield (4), and a chamber. The line (2) ends on the pump side in a first port (130) of said chamber.
According to the invention, the chamber has a second port (131) for connection to a milk collecting container (7). The two ports
(130, 131) in the chamber are connected to each other in terms of fluid communication. During the expressing operation, the line
(2) forms a milk line for transporting breast milk expressed in the breast shield (4) to the chamber and from the chamber to the
milk collecting container (7). Said pump can be designed to be quiet and small.
