Abstract  =>  In various embodiments optoelectronic devices are described herein. The optoelectronic device may include an optoelectronic cell arranged so as to wrap around a central axis wherein the cell includes a first conductive layer a semi-conductive layer disposed over and in electrical communication with the first conductive layer and a second conductive layer disposed over and in electrical communication with the semi-conductive layer. In various embodiments methods for making optoelectronic devices are described herein. The methods may include forming an optoelectronic cell while flat and wrapping the optoelectronic cell around a central axis. The optoelectronic devices may be photovoltaic devices. Alternatively the optoelectronic devices may be organic light emitting diodes.
