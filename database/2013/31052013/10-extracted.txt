A self dry mop comprises a pipe with a handle, four protruding pieces of square rods screwed to it, having two holes at the
extreme bottom; the pipe being connected to two rods through a screw which runs through the pipe from these holes and ends in
the rods, the rods being attached to a piece of metal/plastic, the piece of metal/plastic being attached to a rubber sheet and mop
cloth woven of 100% nylon yarn, sewed to the rubber sheet. There is a bucket / container for containing water along with a fixture
for placing the mop when not in use. To use, the mop is dipped in water, taken out and rested on the fixture for less than 1 minute
to drain out the excess water. It is then put on the floor in such a way that the entire mop cloth is spread on the floor and used to
clean every nook and corner of the floor by maneuvering the handle, which can move 180 degrees - 90 degrees on each side. In
the whole exercise, the user has not used hands or external device to wring dry the mop cloth and the entire operation is performed
very fast and with least effort.
