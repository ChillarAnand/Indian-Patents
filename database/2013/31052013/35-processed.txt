Abstract  =>  Systems and methods may provide for identifying runtime information associated with an active workload of a platform, and making an active idle state determination for the platform based on at least in part the runtime information. In addition, a low power state of a shared resource on the platform may be controlled concurrently with an execution of the active workload based on at least in part the active idle state determination.
