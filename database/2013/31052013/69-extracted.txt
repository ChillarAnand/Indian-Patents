(57) Abstract :
A treatment element (31, 32) to treat material in a multi-shaft worm machine has an outer contour (A(∆ф)) with at least one outer
contour portion (A(∆ф)), the associated evolute (E) of which is a quantity of at least three points, each of t he points lying outside
the longitudinal axis (M) and within the outer radius (Ra ) of the treatment element (31, 32) and two respective adjacent points
having a spacing from one another, which is less than half the core radius (Rj). The treatment element (31, 32) ensures high
flexibility during the adjustment of shear and/or extensional flows on the material to be treated.
