(57) Abstract :
Systems and methodologies are described herein that facilitate a centralized structure for managing multi-radio coexistence for a
mobile device and/or other suitable device(s). As described herein a control plane coexistence manager (CxM) entity and/or a
data plane CxM entity can be implemented to directly interact with a set of associated transceivers (e.g. radios etc.) in order to
manage conflicts between events corresponding to the transceivers. Further CxM operation can be divided between the control
and data planes such that the control plane handles configuration and long-term operations such as radio registration sleep mode
management long-term event resolution interaction with upper layers etc. while the data plane handles short-term operations
with respect to radio event management based on incoming notifications or event requests. For instance the data plane can
evaluate a set of requested events select event(s) to be executed and provide responses to the associated transceivers relating to
the selection(s).
