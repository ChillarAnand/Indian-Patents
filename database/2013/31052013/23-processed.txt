Abstract  =>  The present invention discloses a rain sensor. The rain sensor has a predetermined geometry which causes the rain water drops to form a film or column on the sensor surface. This film or column of water causes a change in the impedance of the sensor. This change in impedance of the sensor is used for automatically varying the rate of rotation of the windshield wiper.
