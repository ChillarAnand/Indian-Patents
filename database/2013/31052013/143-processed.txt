Abstract  =>  The invention relates to a cylinder-piston unit (10) of a one-time injector having at least one penetration (25) connecting the cylinder interior (31) to a face end opening (29). The end face (12) of the cylinder-piston unit comprises a press- in area (60) surrounding the opening and a press-on area (80) surrounding the press-on area. The press-in area comprises an interior bar (62) bounding the opening and an external bar (63). The bars bound a recess surrounding the interior bar the depth thereof measured parallel to the center axis (15) of the cylinder- piston unit is at least a fourth of the width thereof in a plane oriented normal thereto. The press-on area is shifted at least during an injection against the injecÂ¬tion direction (2) toward the end face (61) of the insertion area.
