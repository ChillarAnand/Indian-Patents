Abstract  =>  The present invention relates to coated dehydrated microorganisms comprising a dehydrated microorganism surrounded by at least one coating said coating comprising by dry weight at least 25% of hygroscopic salt(s) and wherein the pH of the coating is compatible with viability of the coated dehydrated microorganism. The coating can be partially crystalline the salt(s) in the coating having preferably a crystallinity degree of up to 60% once applied onto the dehydrated microorganism. The present invention also relates to liquid coating compositions methods for coating and protecting a dehydrated microorganism. Finally the present invention relates to a method for the preparation of food products feed products consumer healthcare products or agri- products as well as to a food product feed product a consumer healthcare product or an agri-product containing such coated dehydrated microorgansims.
