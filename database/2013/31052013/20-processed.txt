Abstract  =>  A hydrocarbon fuel oil emulsion containing stable micro-nano micelles of micro-nano bubbled water with Brown™s Gas (oxy hydrogen) in continuous medium of hydrocarbon fuel oil to reduce overall emissions and to increased efficiency without compromising significant loss in BTU and cetane number for internal as well as external combustion engines. And flexible and efficient process for manufacturing the same comprising the steps of filtration of source water and hydrocarbon fuel oil, additive package formulation, pre-mixing of additive package with hydrocarbon fuel oil, ionization of water to get cationic and anionic water, oxy hydrogen gas generation from cationic water, generation of micro-nano bubble of oxy hydrogen gas in anionic water, and finally preparing emulsion of premixed hydrocarbon fuel oil containing additive package with micro-nano bubbled water containing micro nano bubbles of oxy hydrogen gas.
