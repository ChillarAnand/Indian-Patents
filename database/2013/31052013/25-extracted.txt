(57) Abstract :
This invention relates to a system and method by which data exchange and analytics can be built over communication channels in
general and Interactive Voice Response Systems (IVRS) in specific. IVR systems are available commonly for variety of purposes
such as banking transaction, railway inquiry, complaint registration, automated appointment and so on. There is no logic built
inside these systems to differentiate or identify the similarity of the input and output of the data. This nature makes these IVR
systems unintelligent. The data collected by these IVR systems doesnt carry the essential meta data associated with it (that is the
semantics of the data) and because of this, IVR generated data is not interoperable. This invention provides a new type of
machines where an intelligence layer is built into the IVR systems for interoperability of the services and adds very high
commercial as well as personal benefits to its users.
