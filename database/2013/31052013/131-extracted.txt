(57) Abstract :
Embodiments of the present invention relate to a radio self-backhaul method, device, and system in an evolved network. With the
radio self-backhaul method, device, and system provided in the embodiments of the present invention, the NodeB sends the uplink
data to the core network by using the cable transmission link without occupying the radio resources of other NodeBs. This
implements the radio self-backhaul for the NodeB, saves the radio transmission resources of the NodeB, and mitigates the impact
on the radio network throughput.
