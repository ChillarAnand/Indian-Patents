Abstract  =>  A transmission device (1) with power branching is described. In the first driving range the mechanical power branch (5) transmits torque from the ring gear (25), via the fixed wheel (26), to the further fixed wheel (27). In the process a branching off from the ring gear (25) takes place. The hydrostatic power branch (3) branches off from the second sun gear (22). The hydrostatic power branch transmits power from the first hydraulic unit (10) to the second hydraulic unit (11). The first hydraulic unit (10) operates as a pump and the second hydraulic unit (11) as a motor. At one of the hydrostatic shafts (28) the mechanical power and the hydrostatic power are summed and transmitted via the fixed wheel (36) to the drive output. In the second driving range the power coming from the planetary carrier (24) is partially branched off to the ring gear (25) and transmitted via the gearwheels (26, 27) on the hydrostatic shaft (28) to the second hydraulic unit (11). From the second hydraulic unit (11) the hydraulic power is passed to the first hydraulic unit (10). In the process the first hydraulic unit (10) operates as a motor and the second hydraulic unit (11) as a pump. From the second sun gear (22) the power is then transmitted to the double planetary gear (23), where it is summed.
