Abstract  =>  Techniques for sending control information in the header of multiple packets are described. The techniques may allow more control information to be sent using a small number of overhead bits per packet. In one design a first node (e.g. a network entity) may determine control information to send to a second node (e.g. a UE or another network entity). The first node may send the control information in the header of multiple packets toward the second node. In one design the control information may include congestion information indicative of traffic congestion at the first node. The congestion information may be sent using Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) bits in the header of IP packets. The first node may send the control information with or without coding and for all packets or a specific data flow. The first node may also send a synchronization sequence prior to the control information.
