(57) Abstract :
Disclosed herein is a sample collection device for an aqueous fluid, such as whole blood, serum, plasma and urine. The device
comprises a cartridge body defining an elongate sample collection passage that has open ends. The passage is arranged to draw the
fluid into the passage by capillary action. The passage is provided along a portion of its length with a sample metering stop in the
form of a hydrophobic coating arranged to prevent flow of the fluid by capillary action thereacross. A sample receiving portion of
the passage extending between a collection end and the metering stop is non-linear, and preferably defines a pair of straight limbs
connected by a bend. By providing a non-linear passage in this way, the maximum gravitational force which can act on the
collected sample is reduced as compared to a conventional linear passage, thereby reducing the tendency of the sample to leak
from the device and potentially avoiding the need for one or both ends of the passage to be sealed. The sample receiving portion
of the passage may be provided with a hydrophilic coating to enhance the capillary action. A particularly suitable hydrophilic
coating for a whole blood sample collection device is heparin, which may also serve as an anticoagulant for the blood.
