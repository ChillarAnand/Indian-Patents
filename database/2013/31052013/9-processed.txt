Abstract  =>  A Retractable Vehicle Shade comprises a pipe closed with caps having holes; two shafts - one smaller, enter the pipe from both the ends; shafts other ends rest on metal pieces; a spring encloses shaft inside the pipe - one end attached to shaft and the other to cap; white waterproof cloth with magnets attached to its other end is wound on the pipe; one end of the acrylic foam tape is attached to the metal piece and the other to the vehicle body when the device is fitted to the vehicle. After parking the vehicle in the sun or otherwise, cloth is pulled out and spread on the windshield / windowpane by attaching the magnetic part of the cloth to the metallic / iron part of the vehicle body. When suns rays fall on the white cloth, being opaque, it does not allow them to enter the vehicle, but reflects them and does not become hot. Vehicles inner temperature does not go up. Moreover, the glass remains clean and dry even during dusty, cold, rainy and snowy weather. To resume driving, the magnetic end of the cloth is lifted and released so that the cloth again gets wound on the pipe.
