(57) Abstract :
A mobile device or access terminal of a wireless wide area network (WWAN) communication system is provisioned for Multi-
Mode System Selection (MMSS) wherein an MMSS System Priority List (MSPL) is used with respect to the underlying system
selection priority list (e.g. Private Land Mobile Network (PLMN) list). Relating a current location to one or more entries in an
MMSS Location Associated Priority List (MLPLs) enables scaling a range of entries in the PLMN list indicating whether the
MSPL apply to the entire list of PLMNs stored in an access terminal or to some subset of the PLMN List. Similarly the present
innovation addresses whether the MSPL applies to the entire Preferred Roaming List (PRL) or some subset of a geo-spatial
location (GEO) area.
