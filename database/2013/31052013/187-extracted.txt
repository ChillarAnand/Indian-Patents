(57) Abstract :
A method for reducing average current consumption in a local oscillator (LO) path is disclosed. An LO signal is received at a
master frequency divider and a slave frequency divider. Output from the master frequency divider is mixed with an input signal to
produce a first mixed output. Output from the slave frequency divider is mixed with the input signal to produce a second mixed
output. The second mixed output is forced to be in phase with the first mixed output.
