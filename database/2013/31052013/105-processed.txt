Abstract  =>  A compressing unit 6 of a video encoding device selects whether or not to transform and quantize a prediction error signal 5 after a down sampling processing unit 36 performs a reduction transformation on the prediction error signal 5 by-using a transforming process determining unit 31, and then creates quantization coefficient data 7a or 7b. When the compressing unit creates the quantization coefficient data 7b, a local decoding unit located behind the compressing unit inverse-quantizes and inverse- transforms the quantization coefficient data 7b, and, after that, an up sampling processing unit performs an enlargement transformation on the quantization coefficient data to create a decoded prediction error signal.
