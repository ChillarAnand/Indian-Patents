(57) Abstract :
The invention relates to a device for transmitting electrical energy between a supply component (33) arranged at a furniture body
(31) and a recipient component (32) arranged on a furniture part (5) that can be moved relative to the furniture body (31), in
particular a drawer that can be displaced relative to the furniture body (31), wherein the supply component (33) has an
electromechanical contact set (23, 24), which can be coupled to an electromechanical contact set (16, 17) of the recipient
component (32) in a closed position of the movable furniture part in order to transmit electrical energy, wherein a. the supply
component (33) has a position detection unit (25, 34) coupled to an electrical control circuit (36) and an electromagnet (14, 22)
that can be controlled by the electrical control circuit (36), and wherein b. the recipient component (32) has a magnetizable
element (35), wherein the electromagnet (14, 30) and the magnetizable element (35) are located opposite of each other in a closed
position of the movable furniture part (5) such that the contact sets (16, 17, 23, 24) can be brought into contact with each other by
activating the electromagnet (14, 22).
