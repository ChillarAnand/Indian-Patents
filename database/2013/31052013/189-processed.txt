Abstract  =>  A method is provided of creating an end-to-end entanglement (89) between qubits in first and second end nodes (81L 81R) of a chain of optically-coupled nodes whose intermediate nodes (80) are quantum repeaters. Local entanglements (85) are created between qubits in neighbouring pairs in the chain through interaction of the qubits with light fields transmitted between the nodes. A trigger (82) propagated along the chain from one end node (81L) sequentially enables each quantum repeater (100; 210) to effect a top-level cycle of operation. In each such cycle a repeater (80) initiates a merging of two entanglements involving respective repeater qubits that are at least expected to be entangled with qubits in nodes disposed in opposite directions along the chain from the repeater. A quantum repeater (80) adapted for implementing this method is also provided.
