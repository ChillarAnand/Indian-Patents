(57) Abstract :
The present invention relates to the method of fabricating nanoparticulate films of gold (au) and Silver (Ag) by spray pyrolysis
technique and also tuning of surface plasmon resonance peaks. The method involves the atomization of solution containing the
appropriate metal salt for making a nanoparticulate film. The nanoparticulate film formation takes place onto a heated substrate
upon thermal decomposition of salt and the volatile non-constituent elements related to the salt are removed along with the
solvent. The size and distribution of isolated nanoparticles in films are controlled by simply changing the spray deposition
parameters.
