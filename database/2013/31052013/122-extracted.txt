(57) Abstract :
The present invention relates to a method for preparing a variant lipolytic enzyme comprising expressing in a host organism a
nucleotide sequence which has at least 90% identity with a nucleotide sequence encoding a fungal lipolytic enzyme and comprises
at least one modification at a position which corresponds in the encoded amino acid sequence to a) the introduction of at least one
glycosylation site (or one additional glycosylation site) in the amino acid sequence compared with the original fungal lipolytic
enzyme; b) the introduction of at least one amino acid at a surface position on the polypeptide and at a location in an external loop
distal to the active site (catalytic triad) of the enzyme which is more hydrophilic (compared with the original amino acid); or c) a
substitution or insertion at one or more of positions 33, 63, 78, 190, 305, 306 or 320 or a deletion at one or more positions 311-312
or 307-319, wherein each amino acid position corresponds to the position of the amino acid sequence when aligned with SEQ ID
No. 2; wherein when the nucleotide sequence has at least 90% identity with a nucleotide sequence encoding the fungal lipolytic
enzyme shown in SEQ ID No. 22 or SEQ ID No. 23 the modification is not a substitution at position 63 and the deletion is not at
position 311-312. Preferably the nucleotide sequence has at least 90% identity with SEQ ID No. 1. The invention also relates to
polypeptide produced by the method and to novel nucleic acids.
