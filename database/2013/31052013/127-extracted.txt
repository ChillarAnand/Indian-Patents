(57) Abstract :
An adaptable network security system includes trust mediator agents that are coupled to each network component. Trust mediator
agents continuously detect changes in the security characteristics of the network and communicate the detected security
characteristics to a trust mediator. Based on the security characteristics received from the trust mediator agents, the trust mediator
adjusts security safeguards to maintain an acceptable level of security. Trust mediator also uses predetermined rules in
determining whether to adjust security safeguards. Despite inevitable changes in security characteristics, an acceptable level of
security and efficient network operation are achieved without subjecting users of the network to over burdensome security
safeguards.
