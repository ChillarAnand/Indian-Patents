Abstract  =>  Cement compositions are used to form skins on ceramic honeycombs, or to cement smaller honeycombs to other honeycombs or other materials to form assemblies. The cement composition contains an inorganic filler, and either colloidal silica, colloidal alumina, or both. The inorganic filler and the colloidal materials individually or collectively supply silicon and aluminum atoms. The cement composition is fired in the presence of a fluorine source. A preferred fluorine source is residual fluorine that is contained in an acicular mullite honeycomb. Residual fluorine is released during the firing step, and facilitates the production of mullite in the cement composition as it is fired.
