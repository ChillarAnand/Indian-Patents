(57) Abstract :
A method for compensating a transceiver for impairments includes transmitting a plurality of partial bandwidth training signals
using a transmitter. A plurality of response signals of a receiver having a bandwidth and exhibiting receiver impairments is
captured. Each response signal is associated with one of the partial bandwidth training signals. Each of the partial bandwidth
training signals is associated with a portion of the receiver bandwidth. A plurality of partial compensation filters is generated
based on the plurality of response signals. Each partial compensation filter is associated with one of the response signals. The
partial compensation filters are combined to configure a receiver compensation filter operable to compensate for the receiver
impairments.
