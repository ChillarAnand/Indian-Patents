(57) Abstract : 
The subject matter describes a method for determining a total cylinder charge (rfrges) in cylinders (3) of an internal combustion 
engine (2) having an exhaust gas recirculation system (7). The method includes recirculation of exhaust gas at an introduction point 
(10) into an intake pipe (4) for supplying a gas mixture into the cylinders (3). Then, the total cylinder charge (rfrges) indicates an 
instantaneous total gas quantity in the cylinders (3). The total cylinder charge (rfrges) is determined as a function of a sum of a gas 
mass flow supplied to the intake pipe (4) and as a function of a first dynamic correction factor (fvisrm), which defines the dynamic 
characteristic of the intake pipe (4) with respect to an intake pipe pressure (ps) that develops there.
