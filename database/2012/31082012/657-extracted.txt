(57) Abstract : 
This invention relates to a bipolar antimicrobial particle for use in laundry detergent compositions, fabric conditioners, personal care 
and cosmetic compositions and a process for making the same. In view of the foregoing, it is an object of the present invention to 
provide a stabile antimicrobial agent immobilised on a carrier particle. It is a further objective to provide an antimicrobial particle with 
improved retention to the fabric so that larger amounts of antimicrobial will be available even after rinsing. Surprisingly it has been 
found that antimicrobial molecules tagged by surface reaction onto naturally occurring asymmetric clay surfaces, act as an 
antimicrobial particle with improved retention properties with improved stability.
