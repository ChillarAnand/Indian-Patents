(57) Abstract : 
A solution for multiple base station collaborative communication in TDD (Time Division Duplex) and FDD (Frequency Division 
Duplex) systems is provided. To be specific, a serving base station and coordinating base station transmit detection signals with 
specific Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) features on one or more communication resources. The mobile station measures the 
detection signals on the one or more communication resources and generates indication information of the recommended collaborative 
communication modes based on the measurement results. Preferably the indexes of the time-frequency resources corresponding to the 
recommended collaborative communication modes are reported to the serving base station. Then the serving base station schedules at 
least one of the one or more mobile stations according to the indication information reported by the one or more stations and provides 
MIMO communication manner for the mobile station scheduled. The coverage of the cells is improved, the cell edge user throughput 
is increased and the inter-cell interference between neighboring base stations is decreased by exploiting the invention. Preferably the 
amount of uplink feedback information is decreased and the uplink bandwidth is saved.
