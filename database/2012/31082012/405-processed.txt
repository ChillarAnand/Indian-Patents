Abstract  =>  To provide a pharmaceutical product (chemotherapeutic agent) effective in the prevention and treatment of hyperlipidemia, obesity, etc. [Solving Means] A phenylimidazole compound represented by the following General Formula (1): wherein, R1 represents a hydrogen atom, a phenyl lower alkyl group optionally having a substituent, or a pyridyl lower alkyl group optionally having a substituent, and the benzene ring and the pyridine ring are optionally substituted with 1 or 2 substituents selected from the group consisting of halogen atoms, cyano group and halogen-substituted lower alkyl groups. One of R2 and R3 represents a hydrogen atom and the other represents a lower alkoxy group. R4 represents a phenyl group optionally having a substituent. R5 and R6 are the same or different, and represent a hydrogen atom or a lower alkyl group. R7 and R8 are the same or different, and represent a hydrogen atom or a lower alkoxy group. However, when R1 represents an unsubstituted phenyl lower alkyl group, R2 represents a lower alkoxy group, R3 represents a hydrogen atom, R4 represents a phenyl group optionally having a substituent, and R5 represents a hydrogen atom, R6 is not a hydrogen atom.
