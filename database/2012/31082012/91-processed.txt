Abstract  =>  The present invention relates to a transmitting and a receiving methods of a modulated data stream (MOD). It is characterized in that at the transmitting side, it comprises the steps of Generating a mixed data stream (MD) on the basis of mixing a first data stream (HP) with a second data stream (LP); Encoding said first data stream (HP) and said mixed data stream (MD); Generating a modulated data stream (MOD) on the basis of mapping said mixed data stream (MD). At the receiving side, it comprises the steps of Generating a demapped data stream on the basis of demapping said modulated data stream (MOD); Generating a first and a second deinterleaved data streams on the basis of deinterleaving said demapped data stream; Decoding said first deinterleaved data stream; - Generating an a priori information on the basis of mixing a part of the first decoded deinterleaved data stream with a mixing vector; and Decoding said second deinterleaved data stream using said a prior information.
