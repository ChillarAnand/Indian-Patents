Abstract  =>  The present subject matter relates to a high-pressure fuel pump (10) for an internal combustion engine (9) with direct injection. The high-pressure fuel pump (10) includes a low-pressure region (12) and a quantity control device. According to the present subject matter, the quantity control device includes a control valve (28) that is disposed upstream from an inlet valve (22) of the high-pressure fuel pump (10). The control valve (28) has a first control position and at least one second control position, where the first control position differ from the second control position in their flow restriction effect.
