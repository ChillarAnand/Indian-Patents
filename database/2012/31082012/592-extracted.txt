(57) Abstract : 
A curve (2, 3, 4) of maximum allowable engine torque as a function of engine rotational speed for controlling a combustion engine, 
where a combustion engine control unit is arranged to control output torque and engine rotational speed as not to exceed said curve, 
and where said curve is defined by a torque build up range (n0 to ni), constant power range (n2 to 113) and a torque ramp down range 
(n3 to n4). Said torque ramp down range is defined so that the engine rotational speed at high engine power is reduced, while high 
engine rotational speeds are allowed at low engine power.
