Abstract  =>  The present invention relates to a vertical axis wind turbine generator comprising one turbine. The turbine comprises a plurality of V- shape longitudinal cup type blades mounted horizontally in one or more circulars around a rotor to received the wind mass and push the turbine to rotate, a step-up gear to increase the turbine shaft rotation speed, a generator is to be rotated by the drive shaft of step-up gear, a lift-up equipment for eliminating friction loss at the bearings while the turbine rotation to make it rotate similarly; freely floated in the air, and a set of wind velocity accelerating tunnel to increase wind mass blowing from any directions to a higher velocity than the natural instantaneous wind speed when approaching blades front. The turbine set is installed on a tower structure.
