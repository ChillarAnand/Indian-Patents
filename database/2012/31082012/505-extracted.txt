(57) Abstract : 
Provided are an internal gear machining method and an interna] gear machining device, by which a precise tooth profile grinding can 
be realized by correcting a tooth profile error when grinding of a tooth profile of an internal gear is performed using a barrel-shaped 
threaded grinding wheel. An NC device (31) which functions as a tooth profile error correction means in an internal gear grinding 
machine (internal gear machining device) reduces a measured pressure angle error (∆faL ∆faR) of a workpiece (W) (internal gear) at a 
tooth face by correcting the radial position/ the lateral position of the grinding wheel, the turning angle of the grinding wheel, and the 
helical motion; reduces a measured error (∆L) in the direction of a tooth trace of the workpiece (W) at a tooth face by correcting the 
helical motion; and reduces a measured tooth thickness error (Ath) of the workpiece (W) at a tooth face by correcting the radial 
position, the lateral position of the grinding wheel, and the helical motion.
