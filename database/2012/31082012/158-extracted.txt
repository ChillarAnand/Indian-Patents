(57) Abstract : 
If there is a service provider for which basic registration has already been performed, the processing proceeds to step S15 to determine 
whether there is an IP broadcast service or not. If no IP broadcast service is provided, the processing proceeds to step S17 to determine 
whether there is another service provider for which the basic registration has already been performed. If no other service provider for 
which the basic registration has already been performed is found in this determination, a transition is made to a portal site of the 
service provider for which the basic registration has already been performed. If it is determined that an IP broadcast service is 
provided in step S15, the processing proceeds to step S16 to perform a caution display. In the caution display, a display is made to 
prompt acquisition of channel information. In the case of acquiring channel information, an indication informing the user is displayed 
so that the channel information can be acquired at this phase. Thereby, when IP broadcasting is selected, the receiver determines 
whether there is a broadcast viewable with the receiver and changes a screen after transition, thus enabling the user to perform an 
operation without any confusion.
