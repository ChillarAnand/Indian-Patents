Abstract  =>  A control pin system, including an apparatus and method, for use in controlling the flow of molten metal in a molten metal distribution system for casting, with some aspects of the control pin including: a control pin body with an internal cavity and an outer surface, wherein the outer surface is sized and configured to operatively interact with an internal surface of a spout to effectively control the flow of molten metal through a spout aperture; and a heater element within the internal cavity of the control pin body. In other embodiments, the heater may be located within the spout body and transferring heat to the control pin.
