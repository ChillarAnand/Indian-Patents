(57) Abstract : 
The invention relates to a system and devices for assisting in planting and growing floating macrophyte-type plant species in uses for 
the purification of water, comprising the use of three devices preferably formed from low-density plastic materials: a plane polygonal 
floating structure with elements for connecting to other floating structures, provided with at least one inner coupling bar connected to 
the contour of the floating structure or to another inner bar by means of a flexible arc; a plane cross-linked structure with elements for 
anchoring to the floating structure and at least one central circular housing; and a basket or cone consisting of a flexible plastic 
material and containing a copy of a macrophyte plant, a root cutting or rhizome with a troncoconical form.
