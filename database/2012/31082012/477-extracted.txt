(57) Abstract : 
Techniques for supporting periodic and other location services with Secure User Plane Location (SUPL) and other location 
architectures are described. The techniques can provide position estimates for a SUPL enabled terminal (SET) to a SUPL agent 
periodically and/or based on trigger events. A Home SUPL Location Platform (H-SLP) receives from the SUPL agent a request for 
position estimates for the SET. The H-SLP starts a SUPL location session with the SET. For each of at least one reporting event 
during the location session  the H-SLP obtains a position estimate for the SET and sends the position estimate to the SUPL agent. The 
position estimate may be derived by the SET and sent to the H-SLP. Alternatively  the position estimate may be derived by the H-SLP 
based on measurements from the SET.
