(57) Abstract : 
A population of nanoparticles is disclosed. The population is comprised of a plurality of core/shell nanocrystals, each including: a 
semiconductor core, an intermediate semiconductor shell layer disposed over the semiconductor core, an external semiconductor shell 
layer disposed over the intermediate semiconductor shell layer, and a hydrophilic organic layer in direct contact with the external 
semiconductor shell layer. The population of nanoparticles has a Î±on value of less than about 1.4.
