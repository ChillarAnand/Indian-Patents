(57) Abstract : 
The present invention provides a dual port monotube suspension system type shock absorber and coil spring suspension type system 
having an accumulator for storing fluid, such as hydraulic oil, under gas pressure or without pressure, having fluid communication 
across movable piston and stationary base valve with valves arrangement so that the fluid is continually being transferred between the 
accumulator, the piston with valving and base valve case with valving, thus generating damping force in response to movement of the 
wheels of the vehicle on road with which the system is associated in use of the vehicle.
