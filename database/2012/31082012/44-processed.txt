Abstract  =>  A closed subscriber group (CSG) cell is a cell that allows use of subscribers. In order to receive the service by the CSG cell, a CSG-ID is required to be notified to a user equipment, which cannot be obtained in a situation outside the reach of radio waves from a non- CSG cell. In a mobile communication system including base stations respectively provided to a CSG cell and a non-CSG cell in which access is made to the CSG cell with the use of a CSG-ID issued in a case where use of the CSG cell is allowed, the base station provided in the CSG cell refers to the notified identification information of a user equipment and then transmits a tracking area update request from the user equipment to a core network, and the core network determines whether the user equipment is allowed to use the CSG cell and, in the case where the use is allowed, transmits a signal for allowing assignment of radio resources to the user equipment and the CSG-ID. The user equipment accesses the CSG cell with the use of the CSG-ED.
