(57) Abstract : 
[0028] The invention relates to a process for producing siloxanes comprising reacting at least two siloxanes in the presence of an ion 
exchange resin catalyst comprising from 6 to 19 weight %, based upon the dry weight of the ion exchange resin catalyst, water, at a 
temperature from ambient to 110 0C. The invention also relates to a process for reusing the ion exchange resin catalyst after the 
reacting of the at least two siloxanes in the presence of the ion exchange resin catalysts comprising adding water to the ion exchange 
resin catalyst to readjust the water content to from 6 to 19 weight % water, based on the dry weight of the catalyst, and then reacting at 
least two siloxanes in the presence of the readjusted water content ion exchange resin catalyst.
