(57) Abstract : 
The characteristic casing (1) for surrounding a linear conductor (4) includes at least one inner cavity (7) for receiving at least one 
fiber-optic or current transformer sensor wound around the casing and providing a current measurement. The cavity is closed except 
for small openings in the outer wall (14) through which the sensors are inserted, through which the sensors are removed for 
replacement, and through which the sensors are connected to a measuring instrument. Said cavity is provided with grooves (9) 
arranged on the surface thereof or in mounted tubes for guiding and supporting the turns of the sensors. One of the walls (14) of the 
casing (1) is advantageously aligned with the walls of the adjacent casings (2) in order to ensure an even flow of the induced current 
along the casing.
