Abstract  =>  A quantity of retro reflective granules includes glass members each having a refractie index of at least about 1.5. The quantity of retro refelective granules can be partially embedded into a binder material applied on the surface of a structure to provide a visual aid. A structure includes a retro reflective surface also a binder material applied to at least a portion of inclinded face of the structure.
