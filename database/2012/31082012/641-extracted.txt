(57) Abstract : 
The invention relates to a method for reprocessing waste acid from methods for producing nitroaromatics, in particular for producing 
dinitrotoluene (DNT) or trinitrotoluene (TNT), to recover concentrated and purified sulfuric acid and nitric acid, wherein in a first 
stage, the waste acid is separated in a stripping column countercurrently with water vapor from the bottom of the stripping column into 
at least one vapor phase, which contains nitric acid and possibly nitro-organics, and a pre-concentrated sulfuric acid, and the vapor 
phase and the pre-concentrated sulfuric acid are condensed and/or reprocessed in downstream method stages, wherein in the first stage 
of the method, in addition to the stripping, according to the invention the nitric acid contained in the stripping vapor is concentrated in 
the presence of additional concentrated sulfuric acid so that nitric acid in a highly concentrated form suitable for feeding back into the 
nitriding process is obtained directly in the first stage.
