(57) Abstract : 
Provided is liquid permeable nonwoven fabric having improved air permeability in the direction of the thickness thereof, the 
nonwoven fabric having formed on the surface thereof ridges and troughs extending parallel to each other in one direction. Ridges (6) 
and troughs (7) which extend parallel to each other in the longitudinal direction are formed on the surface (3) of nonwoven fabric (1) 
in which short fibers (2) consisting of thermoplastic synthetic fibers are fusion-bonded together. In a cross-section of a ridge (6) taken 
in the lateral direction (B), the ridge (6) includes side portions (22, 23) on both sides, said side portions (22, 23) having the short fibers 
(2) aggregated densely, and also includes a center portion (21) which is located between both the side portions (22, 23) and in which 
the short fibers (2) are aggregated coarsely. The short fibers (2) in the center portion (21) include short fibers (2a) which connect both 
the side portions (22, 23) at the top (12) of the ridge (6). A method for manufacturing the nonwoven fabric (1) is also provided.
