Abstract  =>  The present subject matter relates to a valve (1) for controlling flow volume, particularly in a heating and/or cooling system of a motor vehicle. The valve (1) includes a disc shaped valve body (2) with at least one control opening (3). Further the disc shaped valve body (2) interacts with a disc shaped sealing body (10) having at least one through hole (11) for controlling the flow volume. The disc shaped valve body (2) includes external gear teeth (49) into which a pinion (42) engages in order to rotate the disc shaped valve body (2). According to the present subject matter, the pinion (42) and the external gear teeth (49) of the disc shaped valve body (2) interact with each other via involute gear teeth (43, 44).
