(57) Abstract : 
The present invention relates to peptides, nucleic acids and cells for use in immunotherapeutic methods. In particular, the present 
invention relates to the immunotherapy of cancer. The present invention furthermore relates to tumor-associated cytotoxic T cell 
(CTL) peptide epitopes, alone or in combination with other tumor-associated peptides that serve as active pharmaceutical ingredients 
of vaccine compositions that stimulate anti-tumor immune responses. The present invention relates to 30 peptide sequences and their 
variants derived from HLA class I and class II molecules of human tumor cells that can be used in vaccine compositions for eliciting 
anti-tumor immune responses.
