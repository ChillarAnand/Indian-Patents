(57) Abstract : 
A method of digitally up-converting a discrete-time baseband signal to a desired frequency comprising: selecting a fixed effective 
sampling rate Fs for a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) used in up-converting the discrete-time baseband signal; performing complex 
tuning on the discrete-time baseband signal to produce a complex tuned discrete-time signal which is translated in the frequency 
domain; up-sampling by N, N>=2, to produce an up-sampled discrete-time signal having a frequency domain representation that 
includes a plurality of equally spaced apart images; filtering the up-sampled discrete-time signal to select at least one image of the 
plurality of images of the discrete-time signal to produce a filtered discrete-time signal; converting the filtered discrete-time signal that 
includes the at least one image to a continuous-time signal using the DAC; and filtering the continuous-time signal to select an image 
located at the desired frequency in the frequency domain; wherein an amount of tuning used in the performing complex tuning step 
and filter coefficients used in the filtering of the discrete-time signal step are each determined as a function of the fixed effective 
sampling rate of the DAC and the desired frequency of up-conversion.
