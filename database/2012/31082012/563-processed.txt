Abstract  =>  The various embodiments of the present invention provide a thermoplastic material to a preset level to avoid melting during an application of normal operating pressure and at normal operating temperature. The present inventions also provide a method of manufacture of thermoplastic components for switch gears. The method includes molding a thermoplastic component to a preset level using a thermal injection molding process and placing the molded thermoplastic component in a carton. The method further includes passing the carton through an irradiation chamber to provide an exposure to gamma radiation or electron beam radiation for cross linking one or more thermoplastic components.
