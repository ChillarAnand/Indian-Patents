(57) Abstract : 
A wearing article configured in such a manner that a liquid absorbing structure, such as an absorbing body, does not separate in the 
front and rear waist regions from the wearers body and, as a result, urine, etc. are prevented from leaking due to the formation of a gap 
between the wearer and the liquid absorbing structure. A diaper (10) includes a front waist member (20), a rear waist member (30), 
and a crotch member (40). The outer surface of a liquid absorbing structure (41) of the crotch member (40) is covered with an outer 
covering sheet (44), and gasket cuffs (50) and leakage barrier cuffs (60) are formed by the outer covering sheet (44). Imaginary 
folding lines (65) extending in the longitudinal direction (Y) are each formed between the proximal edge (62) and the distal edge (63) 
of a leakage barrier cuff (60), and the leakage barrier cuff (60) is folded along the imaginary folding line (65) while a barrier elastic 
member (64) is not being stretched or contracted. The leakage barrier cuffs (60) are joined at the front and rear portions (45, 46) of the 
liquid absorbing structure (41) to an inner covering sheet through a joining means, such as an adhesive agent, and this forms front and 
rear joined regions (66, 67) extending in the longitudinal direction (Y).
