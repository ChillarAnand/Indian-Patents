(57) Abstract : 
A mobile station receives a downlink control structure in a first carrier, where the downlink control structure indicates that control 
information for the mobile station is on a second, different carrier. The mobile station decodes the control information in the second 
carrier, where the control information specifies resource allocation of a wireless link for the mobile station. More specifically, 
according to some implementations, the control channel in the first carrier specifies the resource allocation for an extended control 
channel in the second carrier, where the extended control channel specifies the resource allocation for traffic data of a wireless link for 
the mobile station.
