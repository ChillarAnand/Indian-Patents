Abstract  =>  An information system that comprises a data source that transmits a data item to a group of database instances using a packet-switched communication protocol in which retransmission of the data item to a data base instance is independent from reception of an acknowledgement to the transmitted data item from the database instance. A database instance receives the data item from the data source, stores it as a present data Item and opens access to the present data item. A data consumer queries information on the present data item from the database instance and is provided with means to detect whether the Information included In a response to the query Is valid or not. If the information Is not valid, the data consumer initiates a new query from another destination.
