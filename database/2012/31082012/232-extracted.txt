(57) Abstract : 
Various embodiments relate to wireless communications, and more particularly, to methods and apparatus for authorizing use of 
spectrum, e.g., through the issuance of spectrum access keys, and/or preventing or discouraging the unauthorized use of licensed 
spectrum. Peer to peer wireless communications between authorized users of licensed spectrum may involve scrambling/descrambling 
of information communicated between authorized devices. In some embodiments air interface timing and/or other information 
received from a second device, e.g., a beacon or GPS transmitter, is incorporated into a computation of a pseudo-random bit sequence 
which is also computed based on a spectrum access key communicated to authorized spectrum users. In some embodiments authorized 
peer to peer devices scramble communicated information based on the generated pseudo random bit sequence thereby preventing or 
discouraging communication with devices which are not authorized to use the spectrum and lack a spectrum access key used to 
generate the pseudo random bit sequence.
