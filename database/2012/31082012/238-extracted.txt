The invention relates to a heddle (1), comprising an inserted heddle eyelet (2) with a passage opening (4) for a warp yarn, and an outer 
circumference (5) provided with an edge zone (50) along the edge lines (501), said edge lines being located alongside the inserted 
heddle eyelet (2) when seen in the longitudinal direction of the inserted heddle eyelet (2), and a metal carrier part (3) provided for 
attachment of the inserted heddle eyelet (2) such that, in attached state of the inserted heddle eyelet (2), this carrier part (3) consists of 
a part (3a) that is in contact with the outer circumference (5) of this inserted heddle eyelet (2) and 2 parts (3b) that extend outside the 
inserted heddle eyelet (2), wherein the carrier part (3) is carried out such that at least on one of the said sides (I, II) and at least at the 
transitions from the parts (3b) of this carrier part (3) that extend outside the inserted heddle eyelet (2) towards the part (3a) of this 
carrier part (3) that is in contact with the inserted heddle eyelet (2), it protrudes beyond the edge zone (50) and the outer circumference 
of the inserted heddle eyelet (2) is at least partly visible when the heddle (1) with the inserted heddle eyelet (2) in the attached state is 
viewed from the side, and in which the carrier part (3) is provided such that on each of the left-hand and/or right-hand side (I, II) 
where the carrier part (3) extends, on both the front side (III) and the rear side (IV) of the inserted heddle eyelet (2), the carrier part (3) 
protrudes with respect to the edge zone (50) in each case over at least a part of the length of the carrier part (3) when the heddle (1)
