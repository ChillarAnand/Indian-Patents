(57) Abstract : 
The invention relates to a device for processing a signal delivered by a radiation detector (1), the device comprising a circuit (2, 3) 
able to deliver a voltage pulse whose amplitude is proportional to a charge detected by the detector (1) and an analog/digital converter 
(ADC) which digitizes the voltage pulse and delivers digital signals, characterized in that it comprises, downstream of the 
analog/digital converter (ADC), a processing circuit (5) which comprises: - a unit for reading the digital signals (S(t)) delivered by the 
analog/digital converter (ADC), - a calculation unit which calculates a temporal variation of the digital signals read, and - a circuit 
able to capture the digital signals read whose temporal variation reaches a predetermined threshold.
