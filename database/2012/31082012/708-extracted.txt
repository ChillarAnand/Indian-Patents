(57) Abstract : 
A tolerance ring comprising a metallic band for spring features and a complementary low friction material for frictional considerations 
is disclosed. The tolerance ring is designed to operate within a precisely controlled torque or axial force band to provide a defined 
amount of resistance and sliding force control between components that move relative to each other. Isolated portions of the tolerance 
ring form regions of contact with adjacent ones of the components. Other surfaces of the tolerance ring comprise portions with spring 
features that have geometry suitable for their spring rate, rather than conforming to mating surfaces of the adjacent components .
