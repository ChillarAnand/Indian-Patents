Abstract  =>  The invention relates to a capping head (1) for screwing screw caps (31, 33) onto receptacles, in particular bottles, comprising a central axis (3) and a capping cone (7) that has a cavity (5) holding the screw cap (31, 33) and that has a toothed profile (9), the teeth (11) of which substantially point in the direction of the central axis (3). The cavity (5) has an opening (19). A root diameter of the toothed profile (9) lies on a first imaginary annular surface (13), while a tip diameter of the toothed profile lies on a second imaginary annular surface (15), said first and second annular surfaces (13, 15) being concentric to the central axis (3). The second annular surface (15) and the central axis (3) enclose a first angle α, while a diameter of the capping cone (7) increases in the direction of the opening (19). According to the invention, the first annular surface (13) and the second annular surface (15) enclose a second angle > 0°.
