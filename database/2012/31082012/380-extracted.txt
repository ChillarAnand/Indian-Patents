(57) Abstract : 
The present invention provides a method of inducing cleavage of amyloid precursor protein to produce an approximately 17 kilodalton 
carboxy-terminal fragment of amyloid precursor protein in a subject, the method comprising administering a heterocyclic compound 
or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, hydrate or prodrug thereof to a subject in need thereof, wherein the approximately 17 kilodalton 
fragment includes the carboxyterminal amino acid sequence of amyloid precursor protein and amyloid-beta amino acid sequence. Also 
provided is a screening method for identifying compounds induce cleavage of amyloid precursor protein to produce the approximately 
17 kilodalton carboxy-terminal fragment of amyloid precursor protein.
