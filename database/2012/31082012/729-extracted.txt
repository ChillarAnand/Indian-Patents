An apparatus for monitoring EMG signals of a patients laryngeal muscles includes an endotracheal tube having an exterior surface and 
a first location configured to be positioned at the patients vocal folds. A first electrode is formed on the exterior surface of the 
endotracheal tube substantially below the first location. A second electrode is formed on the exterior surface of the endotracheal tube 
substantially above the first location. The first and second electrodes are configured to receive the EMG signals from the laryngeal
