(57) Abstract : 
The present subject matter relates to a control device (2) for a sensor system (1), where the control device (2) includes at least one 
connection device (9) for connecting a data connection (4) to at least two lines (4a, 4b) as a current interface to at least one sensor (3), 
where through the data connection (4) the connection device (9) receives signals (14) generated by the at least one sensor (3) through 
current modulation of an interface current (I); and a current limiting circuit (10), which limits a short circuit current (I_2, I_3) on at 
least one of the lines (4a, 4b) of the data connection (4) during a short circuit, where the current- limiting circuit (10) limits the short 
circuit current (I_2,1_3) in a temporally varying manner. According to the present subject matter the current limiting circuit (10) limits 
the interface current (I) during the short circuit in a first time interval (t1  t0) to an upper short circuit- current value (I_2) and after the 
first time interval (t1  t0) to a lower short circuit-current value (I_3). The sensor system (1) and the method for transmitting signals 
(14) in the sensor system (1) are also provided.
