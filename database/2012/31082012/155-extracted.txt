(57) Abstract : 
To make a three-dimensional image easily recognizable, in particular when three-dimensional images and two-dimensional images are 
stored in a mixed manner. Interpolation image generation unit (5) generates an interpolation image from original images (L1, R1) 
obtained by photographing a subject from different viewpoints. Motion picture generation unit (6) generates motion picture (DO) in 
which original images (L1, R1), and the interpolation image are arranged in the order of viewpoint. File generation unit (7) generates 
three-dimensional image file (F0) of original images (L1), (R1), motion picture file (M0) of the motion picture, and relational 
information file (R0) representing the relation between three-dimensional image file (F0) and motion picture file (M0), and records 
them on medium (10A) .
