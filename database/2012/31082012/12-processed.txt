Abstract  =>  An apparatus and method provide logic for formatting electronic content. In one implementation, an apparatus includes a generation unit configured to generate a signal for displaying content to a user on a display screen, and a receiving unit configured to receive information associated with a selection by the user of the displayed content. An identification unit is configured to identify a content element corresponding to the displayed content selection, based on at least the received information, and a formatting unit configured to format the identified content element by applying a formatting structure to the identified content element. The generation unit generates a signal for displaying the formatted content element on the display screen.
