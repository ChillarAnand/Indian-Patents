(57) Abstract : 
This method comprises connecting a downstream point (40) of a pipe (24) to a buoy (26) and completely submerging the buoy (26). It 
comprises deploying in the body of water (12) an intermediate section (30) of the pipe (24) from the downstream point (40) to at least 
as far as an upstream point (38), anchoring the upstream point (38), and tensioning the intermediate section (30) to keep it vertical. 
The connecting step includes activating a traction unit (96) to raise the downstream point (40) on the buoy (26). During the connecting 
step, the buoy (26) is carried in the body of water (12) virtually exclusively by its own floatability.
