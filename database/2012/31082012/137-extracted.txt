(57) Abstract : 
The invention is to provide a process of producing the powder of aluminum titanate-based ceramics in which the formation of fine 
particulate component and coarse particulate component is inhibited, and having a very sharp grain size distribution, efficiently and at 
good yield. The invention is a process for producing a powder of aluminum titanate-based ceramics, comprising a step of keeping a 
precursor mixture containing a titanium source powder, an aluminum source powder and a silicon source powder at a temperature 
range of from 1100°C to 1350°C for 3 hours or more, followed by a step of heating the precursor mixture up to 1400°C or more and 
thereafter firing, at this temperature, the precursor mixture after the keeping to obtain a fired body of aluminum titanate-based 
ceramics, and a step of pulverizing and classifying the fired body of aluminum titanate-based ceramics, wherein the step of 
pulverizing and classifying the fired body of aluminum titanate-based ceramics comprises; a step (A) of pulverizing the fired body of 
aluminum titanate-based ceramics with the application of an impact and classifying the pulverized ceramics to obtain a powder of 
aluminum titanate-based ceramics having a prescribed grain diameter or less, and a step (B) of re-pulverizing the rest of the pulverized 
ceramics with the application of an impact and classifying the obtained pulverized ceramics to obtain a powder of aluminum titanate-
based ceramics having a prescribed grain diameter or less.
