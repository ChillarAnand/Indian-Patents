(57) Abstract : 
Disclosed is a system for focus optimization and tracking of sun by solar concentrators. The system comprises one or more solar 
concentrators, at least one imaging device per focus, at least one processor, at least one drive unit, and a plurality of actuators. The 
system performs tracking of sun by the plurality of solar concentrator on basis of a real focus position obtained by the plurality if 
imaging devices rather than on calculated or measured sun position. The system optimizes size and position of the focus until a 
maximum efficiency of the solar system is achieved.
