(57) Abstract : 
In general, this disclosure relates to techniques for automatically supplying a pressurizing unit (e.g., syringe) that is used with a 
powered medical fluid injection device with fluid. An example medical fluid injection device includes a first pressurizing unit and an 
injector head that is configured to obtain operational state information of the device (501) and use the operational state information to 
determine whether a fluid replenishment operation is per miffed for the first pressurizing unit (502), the operational state information 
including information other than a fluid delivery amount for a subsequent injection procedure. If the fluid replenishment operation is 
permitted, the medical fluid injection device supplies the first pressurizing unit with an amount of medical fluid (506).
