Abstract  =>  Disclosed is a galvannealed steel sheet having an excellent surface appearance, wherein plating failure and non-uniform alloying are suppressed. Also disclosed is a method for producing such a galvannealed steel sheet. The galvannealed steel sheet is obtained by hot- dip galvanizing a base steel, and then alloying the plating layer. The base steel is obtained by hot rolling a steel which contains 0.02- 0.25 mass% of C, 0.5-3 mass% of Si, 1-4 mass% of Mn, 0.03-1 mass% of Cr, not more than 1.5 mass% of Al (excluding 0 mass%), not more than 0.03 mass% of P (excluding 0 mass%) , not more than 0.03 mass% of S (excluding 0 mass%) and 0.003-1 mass% Ti, and additionally contains 0.25-5.0 mass% of Cu and 0.05-1.0 mass% of Ni, while satisfying formula (1) , with the balance being made up of iron and unavoidable impurities. [Cu] / [Ni] â‰¥ 5 In formula (1), [] represents the content (mass%) of each element.
