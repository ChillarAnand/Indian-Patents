(57) Abstract : 
Methods and apparatus for making communications decisions are described. In some embodiments, a method includes recovering a 
quality of service level from a transmission request response signal and making a decision whether or not to transmit traffic data based 
on the recovered quality of service level. In other embodiments a method includes recovering a first quality of service level from a 
first transmission request response signal which is in response to a first traffic transmission request signal, and making a decision, 
based on the recovered first quality of service level, whether or not to transmit a second transmission request response signal in 
response to a second traffic transmission request signal. In some embodiments, the phase of the transmission request response signal is 
used to communicate the quality of service level. The device transmitting the transmission request response may also transmit pilots 
which can be used as phase reference signals.
