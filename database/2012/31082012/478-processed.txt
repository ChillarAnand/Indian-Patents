Abstract  =>  An axial gap type rotating machine rigidly fixing the permanent magnets without reducing the magnetic flux and having a high output is provided. An axial gap type rotating machine having: a housing 19; a rotating shaft 11 rotatably supported in the housing; two rotors (15a, 15b), having rotating disks (12a, 12b) rotatable integrally with the rotating shaft 11 as the central axis, and permanent magnets (13a, 13b) arranged concentrically in spaced relation to each other on at least one side of the surfaces of the rotating disks, wherein the surfaces having the permanent magnets face each other in spaced relation; and a stator 18 that is arranged between the rotors facing each other, the stator is spaced from the rotor, and fixed to the housing, the stator having a plurality of coils 16 disposed concentrically around said rotating shaft in spaced relation to each other; wherein magnetic flux generated from the permanent magnets of the rotors intermittently penetrates the interior of each of the coils 16 disposed concentrically around said rotating shaft 11 as it rotates, wherein the rotating disk has a concave portion 21 in the surface facing the stator and the permanent magnets are disposed at the concave portions so as to protrude above the surface of the rotating disk.
