(57) Abstract : 
A system and method for generating energy from the tuning masses relative to a ground plane and an external force In some 
embodiments the external force is the action of the waves The system has a first mass movable relative to the ground plane, wherein 
the external force induces an oscillation in the first mass relative to the ground plane A second movable mass is carried by and 
movable relative to the first movable mass The second movable mass creates kinetic energy as the result of varying the position of the 
second movable mass relative to the first mass The system adjusts or tunes the frequency of various components in relation to the 
natural frequency of the waves The second mass can move relative to the first mass by various methods The energy created by the 
relative motion can be converted to various forms of energy including electrical energy
