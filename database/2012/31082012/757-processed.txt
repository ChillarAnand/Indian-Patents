Abstract  =>  A method of preparing an article includes compressing a polymeric material to form a body and hot isostatic pressing (HIP) the body in an inert atmosphere at a pressure of at least 3 ksi without an encapsulant. The body may optionally be sintered prior to hot isostatic pressing (HIP). The body may have a porosity of not greater than 8 % prior to hot isostatic pressing (HIP). The polymer material may be a non-melt processible polymer.
