beneficial factors such as growth factor, regulatory factors, enzymes, hormones, peptides and lymphokines into the culture medium to 
create conditioned medium and then extracting either a supernatant or a cell free extract of the conditioned medium to use itself or 
components thereof alone or with other skin or hair care reagents as a topical ointment or formula to apply to the skin or hair topically 
for therapeutic and cosmetic purposes.
