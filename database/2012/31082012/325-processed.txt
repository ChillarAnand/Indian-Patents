Abstract  =>  The present invention provides a device for measuring, processing and evaluating medicinal parameters relating to human body, the device comprising: means for measuring transcutaneous carbon dioxide tension (tcPCo2) transcutaneous oxygen tension (PO2), pulse oximetric saturation (Sp02) and blood pH of the subject human body; means for processing the data relating to the transcutaneous carbon dioxide tension (tcPCo2), transcutaneous oxygen tension (PO2), pulse oximetric saturation (Sp,02) and blood pH obtained from the means for measuring; means for obtaining first ayurvedic clinical parameter (VgtC-O) based on the processed data, the first ayurvedic clinical parameter (VgtC-O) indicates ayurvedic vata gati carbon oxygen relationship and evaluates ayurvedic VATA Dosha in the subject human body; means for obtaining second ayurvedic clinical parameter (AgkH) based on the first ayurvedic clinical parameter (VgtC-O) where the second ayurvedic clinical parameter (AgkH) indicates level of hydrogen ion in the body and accordingly heat energy level in the body, the second ayurvedic clinical parameter (AgkH) evaluates ayurvedic PITTA Dosha in the subject human body; means for obtaining third ayurvedic clinical parameter (SHplHC-O) based on the processed data where the third ayurvedic clinical parameter (SHplHC-O) indicates level of bicarbonic acid bicarbonates in the body and accordingly viscosity producing level of blood and body fluids, where the third ayurvedic clinical parameter (SHplHC-O) evaluates ayurvedic KAPHA Dosha in the subject human body; means for obtaining fourth ayurvedic clinical parameter (Agkm) based on the processed data, the fourth ayurvedic clinical parameter (Agkm) indicates hydrogen ion concentration in ayrvedic terminology; means for obtaining fifth ayurvedic clinical parameter (SmO-O) based on the proceesed data, the fifth ayurvedic clinical parameter (SmO-O) indicates water oxygen relationship in ayurvedic terminology; a database including a table illustrating relationship among abnormality and/or disease in the subject human body and at least one of the ayurvedic clinical parameters; means for obtaining sixth ayurvedic clinical parameter (Tdh) based on the processed data, the sixth ayurvedic clinical parameter (Tdh) indicates hydrogen ion concentration in ayurvedic terminology and quantitative range of total dhatus in the subject human body; means for evaluating the affected body part or disease based on the at least one of the ayurvedic clinical parameter and the data given in the table; and display unit for displaying the measured values of transcutaneous carbon dioxide tension (tcPCo2), transcutaneous oxygen tension (PO2), pulse oximetric saturation (Spo2) and blood pH, values of the first ayurvedic clinical parameter (VgtC-O), the second ayurvedic clinical parameter (AgkH), the third ayurvedic clinical parameter (SHplHC-O), the fourth ayurvedic clinical parameter (Agkm), the fifth ayurvedic clinical parameter (SmO-O), the sixth ayurvedic clinical parameter (Tdh), the data given in the table and information showing the affected body part or disease in the subject human body.
