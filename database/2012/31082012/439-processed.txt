Abstract  =>  A method for indicating and determining a carrier scheduling mode in a Long Term Evolution-Advanced (LTE-A) system is disclosed in the present invention. The method is that: a network device determines whether a component carrier adopts a cross-carrier scheduling mode to perform resource scheduling, and transmits first indication information that indicating whether the component carrier adopts the cross-carrier scheduling mode to perform the resource scheduling to a User Equipment (UE), so as to indicate the UE to determine whether adopting the cross-carrier scheduling mode to perform the resource scheduling on a component carrier supported by the UE itself according to the received first indication information. By adopting the present solution, the UE supporting multi-carriers in the LTE-A system is able to determine which mode one certain component carrier or several certain component carriers adopt to perform the resource scheduling, thereby performing data reception/transmission correctly.
