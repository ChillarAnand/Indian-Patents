Abstract  =>  Methods of using recombinant human CClO (rhCC10), also known as recombinant human uteroglobin, to reduce virus titers in the tissues of patients, particularly influenza titers in lung tissues are provided. RhCC10 may be used as a therapeutic in the treatment, cure, or prevention of viral infection, particularly influenza infection. More particularly, methods, including broadly the critical dosage ranges of rhCC10, intravenous and intranasal route of administration, which may be administered to treat, cure or prevent influenza infection are provided. Further provided are compositions useful in the foregoing methods and in administering rhCC10 to humans.
