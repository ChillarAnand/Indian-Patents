Abstract  =>  High yield antibiotics producing fungus strain, preparation method and use thereof are provided. The fungus strain is a mutant derived from Glarea lozoyensis, and deposited in CGMCC with the accession number of CGMCC 2933. The preparation method concludes following steps:(a) mixing the culture media of Glarea lozoyensis strain ATCC 20957 with nitrosoguanidine, and obtaining mixture a; (b) mixing lywallzyme with the mixture a, and obtaining protoplasts; (c) regenerating the protoplasts, and obtaining single clones; and (d) culturing the single clones, then obtaining the mutant stain. This fungus strain has stable genetic and producing property, produces little impurities in fermentation, and is suitable to be used in industry.
