Abstract  =>  Disclosed is a Ti alloy having high strength and excellent workability, and which is suitable for materials for various types of manufacturing such as vehicle manufacturing. Also disclosed is a production method for the Ti alloy. The α martensitic phase structure of the alloy is hot worked under conditions in which dynamic recrystallisation occurs. The processing conditions are that the temperature is increased at a heating rate of 50-800°C/sec, the strain rate at 700-800°C is 0.01-10/sec, the strain rate between 800°C and 1000°C noninclusive is 0.1-10/sec, and the strain is 0.5 or more. Thus, equiaxed crystals with an average crystal grain diameter below 1000nm are obtained.
