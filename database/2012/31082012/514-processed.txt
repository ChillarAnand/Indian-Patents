Abstract  =>  A wearing article configured in such a manner that a liquid absorbing structure, such as an absorbing body, does not separate in the front and rear waist regions from the wearers body and, as a result, urine, etc. are prevented from leaking due to the formation of a gap between the wearer and the liquid absorbing structure. A diaper (10) includes a front waist member (20), a rear waist member (30), and a crotch member (40). The outer surface of a liquid absorbing structure (41) of the crotch member (40) is covered with an outer covering sheet (44), and gasket cuffs (50) and leakage barrier cuffs (60) are formed by the outer covering sheet (44). Imaginary folding lines (65) extending in the longitudinal direction (Y) are each formed between the proximal edge (62) and the distal edge (63) of a leakage barrier cuff (60), and the leakage barrier cuff (60) is folded along the imaginary folding line (65) while a barrier elastic member (64) is not being stretched or contracted. The leakage barrier cuffs (60) are joined at the front and rear portions (45, 46) of the liquid absorbing structure (41) to an inner covering sheet through a joining means, such as an adhesive agent, and this forms front and rear joined regions (66, 67) extending in the longitudinal direction (Y).
