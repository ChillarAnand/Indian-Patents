Abstract  =>  The present subject matter relates to a method for operating a control unit for an electric motor (2). The control unit is provided with a control module (3) for controlling the electric motor (2) and with an intermediate module connected upstream of the control module (3), particularly having an intermediate circuit capacitance (7). The method includes supply of a control variable (SG) for controlling the electric motor (2), adjustment of a variable input voltage (UDC) and supply of the adjusted input voltage (UDC) to the control module (3) across the intermediate module. The control unit (3) is operated as a function of an available intermediate module voltage (Uc) which depends on the adjusted input voltage (UDC), and as a function of the control variable (SG), in order to control the electric motor (2) according to the control variable (SG).
