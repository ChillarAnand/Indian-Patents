Abstract  =>  The image forming apparatus includes process units that are closely arranged around respective photosensitive members and act on the photosensitive members, a light emission section that forms an electrostatic latent image for detection on the photosensitive member and a detection section that detects the electrostatic latent image passes through a position facing to the process unit and a control section that performs misregistration correction control based on the detection result. It achieves to resolve a problem that is caused in detection of a conventional toner image for detection by an optical sensor and to enhance usability of an image forming apparatus.
