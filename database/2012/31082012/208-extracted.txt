(57) Abstract : 
The invention relates to a method for use in a radio communication system (RCS), the radio communication system (RCS) comprising 
at least three base stations (SBS1, MBS1, MBS2), a first one (SBS1) of the at least three base stations (SBS1, MBS1, MBS2) 
hereinafter called first slave base station, a second one (MBS1) of the at least three base stations (MBS1, MBS2, SBS1) hereinafter 
called first master base station, and a third one (MBS2) of the at least three base stations (SBS1, MBS1, MBS2) hereinafter called 
second master base station, the method comprising the step of controlling a first part (PI) of a radio resource allocation domain at the 
first slave base station (SBS1) by the first master base station (MBS1), wherein the method further comprises the step of controlling at 
least a second part (P2) of the radio resource allocation domain at the first slave base station (SBS1) by the second master base station 
(MBS2), and wherein the first part (PI) and the at least second part (P2) of the radio resource allocation domain are disjoined.
