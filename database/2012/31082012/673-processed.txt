Abstract  =>  The invention relates to a method for cosmetic treatment of the hair during an operation for permanent waving of the hair, comprising - a step of breaking the keratin disulphide bonds, by application to the keratin fibres of a composition (A) comprising one or more agents which break keratin disulphide bonds, then, optionally, - a fixing step aimed at closing said disulphide bonds again, by application of an oxidizing composition (B) to the keratin fibres in the case of the use of a reducing agent as breaking agent, it being understood that one or more silicones (i) having a molecular weight of less than 10 000 and functionalized with one or more mercapto groups are introduced into the composition (A) and/or into the oxidizing composition (B) and/or applied to the keratin fibres between the step of applying the composition (A) and the step of fixing by applying the oxidizing composition (B), by means of an intermediate composition (C) containing said silicone(s), wherein said method comprises a step of heating the hair at a temperature ranging from 60 to 220Â°C after application of the silicone(s) (i).
