(57) Abstract : 
Provided is a gear machining machine which has a cutter head with improved rigidity, and contributes to improving machining 
accuracy and making quality uniform when either an external gear or an internal gear has been machined. For this purpose, the gear 
machining machine is equipped with a movement base (12) that is movably supported and rotatably supports a rotation table (13) on 
which an external gear (W1) or an internal gear (W2) is mounted; a bridge section (14c) of a gate-shaped column (14) provided at a 
location above the movement base (12); a saddle (15) which is supported by the bridge section (14c) in a vertically movable manner; 
and a cutter head (16) which is provided on the front surface of the saddle (15), and the lower end of which rotatably supports a tool 
(T). A protrusion (16a) which projects forward is provided on the front surface of the cutter head (16). The tool (T) is disposed in such 
way that the front thereof protrudes further forward of an end surface (16b) which is the most forward projecting portion of the 
protrusion (16a).
