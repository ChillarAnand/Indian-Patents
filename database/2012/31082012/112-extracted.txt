(57) Abstract : 
Systems and methods are disclosed for provisioning a position monitoring device. The position monitoring device may include a 
wireless communication modem (108) and a first serial port (202). A provisioning device (124) may be coupled to the position 
monitoring device (104) through a serial connection. The provisioning device can include a memory, a second serial port, and a 
processor (122). In some embodiments, the provisioning device (116) initiates an automatic configuration of the wireless 
communication modem (108) through a series of attention commands. Systems and methods are also disclosed that include 
provisioning a target device (104) coupled to a wireless network. These systems and methods include a provisioning server (116) 
coupled to the wireless network and a target update (102) coupled to the provisioning server (116). The provisioning server (116) 
includes instructions relating to the configuration of the target device (104). In addition, these systems and methods include a server 
(1016) coupled to the target update (102) and a provisioning user interface coupled to the server that is operable to create parameters 
for a software update and transmit the parameters to the server. The server (116) is operable to communicate the parameters to create 
the target update, and the target update is transmitted through the provisioning server and the wireless network to the target device.
