(57) Abstract : 
Processes and compositions for liposomal delivery of therapeuticals prepared by contacting an aqueous solution of an active agent 
with a solution of liposome-forming components containing one or more DILA2 amino acid compounds or lipids in organic solvent to 
form an impinging stream. A protocol including flow rates, pH, and an incubation period are used to control formation of liposomal 
components for therapeutic applications. The impinging stream may be collected and incubated to prepare a liposomal formulation 
which encapsulates the active agent. The composition can be quenched with buffer and filtered by tangential flow and diafiltration and 
other means for finishing as a pharmaceutical composition. An efficiency for delivering a drug cargo is provided. Compositions can 
include a liposome containing one or more carrier particles, each carrier particle having an active agent and a peptide, wherein the 
ratio of the mass of the peptide plus the mass of the liposome to the mass of the active agent is less than about 15.
