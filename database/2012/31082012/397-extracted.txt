(57) Abstract : 
An electromechanical pressure switch is described comprising a hollow body formed by a base (1) and a cap (9), between which an 
elastically deformable membrane (5) is clamped and closes a pressure sensing chamber (4) which communicates with an inlet hole (3) 
for a pressurized fluid, and lever means (15) for transmitting the deformation of the membrane (5) caused by the pressurized fluid to 
an actuating push button (22) of a switchable microswitch (23). The lever means (15) consist of a one-piece third-kind lever (15), 
comprising a first end bend (16) clamped together with said membrane (5) between said base (1) and said cap (9) and a flat part (18) 
which bears at the free end a projecting rib (21) for controlling said actuating push button (22) of the microswitch (23). The flat part 
(18) of the lever (15) is adjustably fixed to an adjusting screw (13) having an axis coinciding with that of the pressure switch which 
has a spherical tip (12) in contact with a central point (11) of the membrane (5). Fig.1
