Abstract  =>  A filter element (1) comprises opposing end sections (3A, 3B) of a filter material sheet (2) that are connected to each other in a fluid- tight manner, wherein a molded or extruded plastic casing (5) encloses the end edges (4A, 4B) of the end sections (3A, 3B). A method for producing a corresponding filter element (1) comprises the encasing of opposing end edges (4A, 4B) of end sections (3A, 3B) of a filter material sheet (2) with a plastic casing (5) so as to form a continuous bellows.
