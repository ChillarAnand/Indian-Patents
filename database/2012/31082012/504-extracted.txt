(57) Abstract : 
The invention relates to a method for the delivery quantity control of a reciprocating compressor, wherein the motion of a closing 
organ (5b) of an automatic suction valve (5) is influenced during at least one part of a cycle of the crankshaft by means of a retraction 
gripper (6) driven by a control device (2), wherein the method comprises a continuously variable return flow control, wherein the 
retraction gripper (6) contacts the closing organ (5b) and prevents the same from closing during a first partial segment (K1) of the 
cycle of the crankshaft, and wherein the retraction gripper (6) is retracted during a second partial segment (K2) of the cycle of the 
crankshaft and the closing organ (5b) is closed, and wherein the method comprises an interruption control, wherein the retraction 
gripper (6) prevents the closing organ (5b) from closing during an entire cycle of the crankshaft, wherein the delivery quantity is 
controlled at least by a combination of continuously variable return flow control and interruption control, and wherein the closing 
organ (5b) is influenced by the control device (2) and the retraction gripper (6) such that a closing organ (8b) of a pressure valve (8) of 
the reciprocating compressor is opened at least during a prescribed total opening angle (Kv) of a crankshaft.
