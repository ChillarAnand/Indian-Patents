Abstract  =>  A system includes a compressor having a shell housing a compression mechanism driven by an electric motor in an on state and not driven by the electric motor in an off state. The system also includes a variable frequency drive that drives the electric motor in the on state by varying a frequency of a voltage delivered to the electric motor and that supplies electric current to a stator of the electric motor in the off state to heat the compressor.
