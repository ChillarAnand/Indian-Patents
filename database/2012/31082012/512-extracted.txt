(57) Abstract : 
A cutting device 10 for cutting a pipe 32 having a pipe wall is disclosed. The cutting device 10 includes an elongate carrier 12 having 
a tool end 12.1 which is engageable with a power tool and an opposed free end 12.2. The device 10 includes a guide wheel 16 located 
at the free end 12.2 of the carrier 12 which is loosely mounted thereon for rotation relative thereto, having a bearing surface 34 
extending parallel to a longitudinal axis of the carrier 12. The device 10 also includes a cutting element 14 having a peripheral cutting 
edge 36 which is located adjacent to the guide wheel 16 being positioned intermediate the guide wheel 16 and the tool end 12.1. The 
cutting element 14 is of greater transverse dimension than the guide wheel 16 so that when the bearing surface 34 bears against an 
internal surface of the pipe 32 the distance between the cutting edge 36 of the cutting element 14 and the bearing surface 34 enables 
the cutting element 14 to cut through the pipe wall.
