Abstract  =>  A coating composition, system, and method for printing documents that are difficult to chemically or physically forge and that are easy to visually verify are disclosed. The system includes a substrate, a toner, including a colorant and a dye, a coating including fluorescent material, e.g., a primary migration-enhancing coating, applied using an offset printing process and optionally a secondary migration-enhancing coating applied using an offset printing process. An image formed using the toner of the invention is readily verified by comparing a colorant-formed image and a dye-formed image and/or to a reverse negative imaged formed by the dye quenching the fluorescent material. In addition, if a solvent is used in an attempt to alter the printed image on the substrate, the dye migrates or diffuses to indicate tampering with the document.
