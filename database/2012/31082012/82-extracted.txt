(57) Abstract : 
Embodiments of the present invention relate to a UV-curable polyurethane-methacrylate (PUMA) substrate for manufacturing 
microfluidic devices. PUMA is optically transparent, biocompatible, and has stable surface properties. Embodiments include two 
production processes that are compatible with the existing methods of rapid prototyping, and characterizations of the resultant PUMA 
microfiuidic devices are presented. Embodiments of the present invention also relate to strategies to improve the production yield of 
chips manufactured from PUMA resin, especially for microfiuidic systems that contain dense and high-aspect-ratio features. 
Described is a mold-releasing procedure that minimizes motion in the shear plane of the microstructures. Also presented are simple 
yet scalable methods for forming seals between PUMA substrates, which avoids excessive compressive force that may crush delicate 
structures. Two methods for forming interconnects with PUMA microfiuidic devices are detailed. These improvements produce a 
microfiltration device containing closely spaced and high-aspect-ratio fins, suitable for retaining and concentrating cells or beads from 
a highly diluted suspension.
