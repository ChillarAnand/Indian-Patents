Abstract  =>  Disclosed are transplantation cells for an immunotherapy, which are applicable to a wider variety of patients compared to conventional transplantation cells for immunotherapies, and which can survive transiently so that severe GVH disease cannot be induced. Specifically disclosed is a pharmaceutical composition containing cells derived from human hematopoietic stem cells. In the pharmaceutical composition, the genetic locus of at least one human HLA class I molecule in the cells contains at least one antigen for which the type of matching of the cell is identical to that of a patient. The genetic locus of each of the human HLA class I and II molecules in the cells contains at least one antigen for which the type of matching of the cell is not identical to that of a patient, and the cells derived from the hematopoietic stem cells do not cause acute GVH disease having a severity of level III or IV in the body of a patient even when the cells survive in the patient permanently.
