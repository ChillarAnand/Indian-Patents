(57) Abstract : 
A non-woven fabric composite containing natural fibers and a method for producing such composites. The non-woven fabric 
composite is comprised of large diameter, lignin-rich natural fibers with a high viscous flow temperature and a high degradation 
temperature combined with fibers made of a thermoplastic polymer with a lower viscous flow temperature such as polypropylene, 
polyethylene or a biodegradable thermoplastic polymer fiber such as polylactic acid, or mixture thereof. A hot-pressed non-woven 
fabric composite material prepared from the non-woven fabric composite.
