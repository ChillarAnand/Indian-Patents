(57) Abstract : 
The invention relates to a method for operating an ending widget (14) with data retrieved from a starting widget (12), both the starting 
widget (12) and the ending widget (14) being portable software programs installed and executed through a Markup Language Web 
based page in order to display, respectively, at least one visual object (26, 28, 30) and at least one visual area (32, 34, 36), 
characterized in that it comprises the following steps: - The step for the starting widget (12) to detect a drag of the visual object (28) 
and to inform a distant server (38) from such detected drag, - The step for the ending widget (14) to detect a drop in the visual area 
(34) and to inform the distant server (38) from such detected drop, and The step for the distant server (38) to correlate the drag in the 
starting widget (12) with the drop in the ending widget (14) so as to trigger an action whereby data associated to the visual object (28) 
performs a function associated with the visual area (34).
