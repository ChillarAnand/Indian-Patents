To provide a pharmaceutical product (chemotherapeutic agent) effective in the prevention and treatment of hyperlipidemia, obesity, 
etc. [Solving Means] A phenylimidazole compound represented by the following General Formula (1): wherein, R1 represents a 
hydrogen atom, a phenyl lower alkyl group optionally having a substituent, or a pyridyl lower alkyl group optionally having a 
substituent, and the benzene ring and the pyridine ring are optionally substituted with 1 or 2 substituents selected from the group 
consisting of halogen atoms, cyano group and halogen-substituted lower alkyl groups. One of R2 and R3 represents a hydrogen atom 
and the other represents a lower alkoxy group. R4 represents a phenyl group optionally having a substituent. R5 and R6 are the same 
or different, and represent a hydrogen atom or a lower alkyl group. R7 and R8 are the same or different, and represent a hydrogen 
atom or a lower alkoxy group. However, when R1 represents an unsubstituted phenyl lower alkyl group, R2 represents a lower alkoxy 
group, R3 represents a hydrogen atom, R4 represents a phenyl group optionally having a substituent, and R5 represents a hydrogen 
atom, R6 is not a hydrogen atom. [Selected Drawing] None
