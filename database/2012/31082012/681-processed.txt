Abstract  =>  The invention concerns a method of controlling the movement of the push device of a pump of the syringe driver-type, the pump comprising a casing (100), a syringe cradle (200) in which a syringe (400) is placed, a push device (300) mobile relative to the casing (100) and capable of being driven in rotation parallel to the longitudinal axis of the syringe by driving means, clutch means (310, 350, 351) for engaging or disengaging the push device (300) on the driving means. In the method of the invention, the push device (300) is, first of all, disengaged from the driving means, which makes it possible to move it manually, and the presence or absence of a contact between the push device (300) and the syringe head (401) is determined. If the push device is not in contact with the syringe head, it is advanced manually toward the latter. As soon as the push device comes in contact with the syringe head, the advance movement of the push device is stopped. Blocking of the advance movement of the push device is triggered only if, at the beginning of the operation, the push device was not in contact with the syringe head. Contrary to the state of the art, it is not the syringe piston that is blocked, but the movement of the push device that is stopped as soon as there is contact between the syringe and the push device.
