A method of managing traffic flow in a packet network, the method comprising: providing a working sub-network comprising one or 
more provisioned static working paths between at least one source node and one or more destination nodes in the network, and 
associating a service instance with the working sub-network; providing a dynamic backup sub-network comprising one or more 
dynamically maintained protection paths between the at least one source node and the one or more destination nodes, and associating 
the service instance with the dynamic backup sub-network; during a normal operation of the network, forwarding subscriber traffic 
associated with the service instance through the network using the working sub-network; and following detection of a network failure 
affecting the service instance, switching the subscriber traffic associated with the service instance for forwarding through the network 
using the dynamic backup sub-network.
