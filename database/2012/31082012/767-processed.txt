Abstract  =>  An anti-counterfeit method for random texture and a recognizer thereof are provided by the invention. The method includes the following steps: A. texture material 2 with texture element 1 distributed randomly is selected; B. a recognition system stores inherent recognition feature J of texture element 1; C. random feature S distributed in texture 1 is extracted and stored in the recognition system, and texture 2 is enabled to be anti-counterfeit identification 3; D. in recognizing, the recognition system extracts feature J and random feature S of texture element 1 to be recognized on anti-counterfeit identification 3 to be recognized, and compares respectively feature J with recognition feature J as well as random feature S with random feature S, if one or two of the compared results does not match, anti-counterfeit identification 3 to be recognized is judged not to be anti-counterfeit identification 3, otherwise, anti-counterfeit identification 3 to be recognized is judged to be anti-counterfeit identification 3. The method can be applied to implement that the inherent feature of a texture element is not imitated and deceived by a printed texture element, and it can support a cheap and simple recognizer.
