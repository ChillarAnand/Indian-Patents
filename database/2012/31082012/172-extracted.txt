(57) Abstract : 
Techniques for performing transmit power control based on receiver gain setting in a wireless communication network are described. 
In an aspect, a terminal A may estimate pathloss to another terminal B, e.g., based on a peer discovery signal received from terminal 
B. Terminal A may then determine a transmit power level for a peer-to-peer (PTP) signal (e.g., a paging signal) based on the estimated 
pathloss, a receiver gain setting at terminal B, and a target received power level for the PTP signal. Terminal A may send the PTP 
signal at. the determined transmit power level to terminal B. In another aspect, terminal B may use different receiver gain settings in 
different time intervals to receive PTP signals from other terminals. Terminal A may then select a suitable time interval to send the 
PTP signal based on the pathloss and the different receiver gain settings used by terminal B.
