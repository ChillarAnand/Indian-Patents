(57) Abstract : 
A three dimensional woven preform, a fiber reinforced composite incorporating the preform, and methods of making thereof are 
disclosed. The woven preform includes one or more layers of a warp steered fabric. A portion of the warp steered fabric is compressed
into a mold to form an upstanding leg. The preform includes the upstanding leg and a joggle in a body portion. The body portion and 
upstanding leg are integrally woven so there is continuous fiber across the preform. A portion of the warp steered fabric includes 
stretch broken carbon fibers in the warp direction, and another portion includes conventional carbon fibers. The warp steered fabric 
can be woven on a loom equipped with a differential take-up mechanism. The warp steered fabric can be a single or multilayer fabric. 
The preform or the composite can be a portion of an aircraft window frame.
