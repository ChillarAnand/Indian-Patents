(57) Abstract : 
The present invention relates to a quick- fit connection for pipes comprising a body (2) having at least one spigot (4), which extends 
around a longitudinal axis, suitable for being at least partially inserted in the pipe, and a blocking element, suitable for working on the 
outside of the pipe and for cooperating with the body so as to keep the spigot engaged in the pipe. The blocking element comprises at 
least one annular blocking body, which identifies a passage section for the pipe and which comprises blocking teeth (101 ) extending 
radially internally to interfere with the pipe. Moreover, the blocking element is removable from the body.
