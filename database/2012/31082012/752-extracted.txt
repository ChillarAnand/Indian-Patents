(57) Abstract : 
A 3-dimensional porous polymeric structure comprising a porous polymer structure optionally with particles within the pores of the 
polymer and wherein the pores have a narrow pore-size distribution. The structure may be made by closely packing particles in a zone 
to provide a 3-dimensional array, contacting a polymerisable monomer with the array such that the composition fills interstitial spaces 
between the particles and effecting polymerisation of the monomer whereby a polymer structure is formed around the particles and 
optionally removing the particles from the structure. The 3-dimensional porous structure may be used in solid phase synthesis, 
immobilisation, cell culturing and preparation of a stationary phase for chromatographic separation, as an absorbent, an insulating 
material or in tissue regeneration.
