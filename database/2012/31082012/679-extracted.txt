(57) Abstract : 
A method of preparing a compound represented by Structural Formula (I), or a pharmaceuticalry acceptable salt thereof wherein the 
variables of Structural Formula (T) are as described in The specification and claims, comprises the steps of: a) reacting a compound 
represented by Structural Formula (A) with FTNRJR7 under suitable conditions to form a compound represented by Structural 
Formula (B); and b) i) when R12 is -NOz, and RH is -OR14: 1) cyclizing the compound represented by Structural Formula (B) under 
suitable cyclisation conditions to form a compound represented by Structural Formula (II); and 2) optionally reacting the compound 
represented by Structural Formula (H) with R9-LG:, wherein LG2 is a suitable leaving group, to form the compound represented by 
Structural Formula (I), wherein R8 is R9; or ii) when R12 is halogen, and R11 is -NHR13: 1) cyclizing the compound represented by 
Structural Formula (B) under suitable cyclisation conditions to form the compound represented by Structural Formula (I); and 2) 
optionally, when R13 is - H, reacting the compound produced from step b), ii), 1) with R9-LG2, wherein LG2 is a suitable leaving 
group, to form the compound represented by Structural Formula (I) wherein Rg is R9.
