Abstract  =>  A method for producing a thermoplastic film-substrate resistive thick film heating element is described, involving the melt bonding of an electrically insulating, optionally filled high temperature thermoplastic film to a substrate. This thick film heating element includes an optionally filled high temperature thermoplastic film-substrate onto which is deposited at least a resistive thick film, and is capable of operating over a wide range of power densities for consumer and industrial heating element applications.
