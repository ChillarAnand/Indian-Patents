(57) Abstract : 
The various embodiments of the present invention provide a thermoplastic material to a preset level to avoid melting during an 
application of normal operating pressure and at normal operating temperature. The present inventions also provide a method of 
manufacture of thermoplastic components for switch gears. The method includes molding a thermoplastic component to a preset level 
using a thermal injection molding process and placing the molded thermoplastic component in a carton. The method further includes 
passing the carton through an irradiation chamber to provide an exposure to gamma radiation or electron beam radiation for cross 
linking one or more thermoplastic components.
