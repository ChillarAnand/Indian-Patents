(57) Abstract : 
The invention relates to a building material mixture containing a) hydraulic binder, b) aggregate, c) copolymer suitable as plasticizer 
and d) adsorption blocker, the adsorption blocker having, as a base building block, a structural unit D-E-A arising from the reaction of 
the individual components D, E and A, with E represented by a compound having at least two reactive isocyanate groups, D 
represented by a hydrophobic compound having at least one group reactive towards isocyanates, A represented by a hydrophilic 
compound having at least one group reactive towards isocyanates.
