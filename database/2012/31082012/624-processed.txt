Abstract  =>  An apparatus for the treatment of solids and/or gases includes a fluidized-bed reactor (1) in which the solids are fluidized by means of fluidizing gas and are thermally and/or chemically treated, and a centrifugal separator (2) in which gas and solids are separated from each other, wherein the fluidized-bed reactor (1) is connected with the centrifugal separator (2) via a transfer duct (3). To avoid the formation of a streak extremely loaded with solids in the upper region of the centrifugal separator, the transfer duct (3) branches off from the fluidized-bed reactor (1) with a cross-section whose horizontal dimension is greater than the vertical dimension, wherein the cross-section of the transfer duct (3) expands downwards in vertical direction from the fluidized-bed reactor (1) to the centrifugal separator (2).
