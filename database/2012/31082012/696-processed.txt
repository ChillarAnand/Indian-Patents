Abstract  =>  The present invention relates to novel associative monomers, ending in a hydrophobic chain made from polycosanols, which are bio- sourced raw materials, and in particular octocosanol. The invention also relates to HASE associative copolymers produced using said monomers, (meth)acrylic acid and an ester of said acids. The invention finally relates to the use of said copolymers as thickening agents for aqueous formulations.
