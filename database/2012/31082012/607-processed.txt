Abstract  =>  The invention relates to the field of pharmaceuticals. The invention describes block copolymer pharmaceutical compositions containing 3,3-diindolylmethane (DIM). A pharmaceutical composition for peroral administration comprises 3,3-diindolylmethane as active ingredient and a target additive, wherein said composition comprises, as target additive, a block copolymer of oxyethylene and oxypropylene, in which the hydrophobic block content is less than 50% by mass, and the molecular mass of the hydrophilic block is 2250 Da or more, given a ratio of active ingredient to the selected block copolymer of 10:1-2:1. The compositions improve the absorption of the active compound in the bloodstream when said active compound is administered perorally.
