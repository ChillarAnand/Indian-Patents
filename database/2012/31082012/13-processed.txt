Abstract  =>  One embodiment of the present invention provides a system that facilitates interaction between two entities located away from each other. The system includes a virtual reality system, an augmented reality system, and an object-state-maintaining mechanism. During operation, the virtual reality system displays an object associated with a real-world object. The augmented reality system displays the object based on a change to the state of the object. The object-state-maintaining mechanism determines the state of the object and communicates a state change to the virtual reality system, the augmented reality system, or both. A respective state change of the object can be based on one or more of: a state change of the real-world object; a user input to the virtual reality system or the augmented reality system; and an analysis of an image of the real-world object.
