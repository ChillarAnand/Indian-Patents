(57) Abstract : 
A semiconductor device including segments, a power supply pad and conductive patterns is provided. Each segment includes driving 
units for discharging a liquid. Each driving unit includes a driving circuit and an element driven by the driving circuit to apply 
discharging energy to the liquid. The conductive pattern includes a first conductive portion connected to the power supply pad, a 
second rectangular conductive portion, a third conductive portion connected to the driving units, and a connection portion which 
connects the second and third conductive portions. These conductive portions elongate in a first direction. In a second direction, a 
length of the second conductive portion is larger than a length of the first conductive portion. The second conductive portion is 
connected to the first conductive portion at a first corner and the connection portion at a second corner diagonal to the first corner.
