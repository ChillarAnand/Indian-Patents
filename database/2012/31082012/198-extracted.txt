(57) Abstract : 
A reverse-conducting semiconductor device (200) is provided, which comprises a freewheeling diode and an Insulated gate bipolar 
transistor on a common wafer (100), part of which wafer (100) forms a base layer (101) with a base layer thickness (102). The 
Insulated gate bipolar transistor comprises a collector side (103) and an emitter side (104), whereas the collector side (103) Is arranged 
opposite of the emitter side (104) of the wafer (100). A first layer (1) of a first conductivity type and a second layer (2) of a second 
conductivity type are alternately arranged on the collector side (103). The first layer (1) comprises at least one first region (10) with a 
first region width (11) and at least one first pilot region (12) with a first pilot region width (13). The second layer (2) comprises at least 
one second region (20) with a second region width (21) and at least one second pilot region (22) with a second pilot region width (23). 
The RC-IGBT is designed in such a way that the following geometrical rules are fulfilled: Each second region width (21) is the equal 
to or larger than the base layer thickness (102), whereas each first region width (11) is smaller than the base layer thickness (102). 
Each second pilot region width (23) is larger than each first pilot region width (13). Each first pilot region width is the equal to or 
larger than two times the base layer thickness (102) and the sum of the areas of the second pilot regions (22) is larger than the sum of 
the areas of the first pilot regions (12).
