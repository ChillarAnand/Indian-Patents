(57) Abstract : 
Disclosed is a polycondensation catalyst for the production of polyesters by an esterification reaction or a transesterification reaction 
between dicarboxylic acid or an ester-forming derivative of the same, and glycol. In order to obtain the polycondensation catalyst a 
water-soluble titanium compound is hydrolyzed, in the absence of a water-soluble alkali, in an aqueous slurry having solid base 
particles dispersed therein, and a coating layer is formed on the surfaces of the solid base particles. The coating layer comprises, in 
terms of TiO2, 0.1-50 parts by weight of titanic acid per 100 parts by weight of solid bases. Also disclosed are a method for producing 
the polycondensation catalyst, and polyesters obtained using the polycondensation catalyst.
