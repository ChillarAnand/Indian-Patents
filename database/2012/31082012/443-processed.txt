Abstract  =>  Provided is a communication capacity evaluating apparatus whereby the communication capacity can be grasped and the necessity of changing the content of a dead spot measure after the placement of a relay apparatus can be eliminated. In the communication capacity evaluating apparatus, a system information analyzing unit (121) acquires, from a received signal, used-band information of the communication using a MIMO mode. An S/N calculating unit (122) analyzes the received signal to determine a signal-to-noise ratio. A channel estimating unit (123) analyzes the received signal to determine a channel matrix. A throughput limit calculating unit (124) calculates the limit value of the communication capacity on the basis of the used-band information, information about the number of transmission antennas of a base station (180), information about the number of reception antennas of a radio relay apparatus (100) stored in advance, the signal-to-noise ratio and the channel matrix. A display unit (133) displays the result of a comparison between the limit value and a desired value of communication capacity set in advance.
