(57) Abstract : 
A method of multicast route computation in a Link state protocol controlled network, (he method comprising steps of: computing a 
spanning tree from a first node to even other node in the network using a known shortest path tree algorithm: dividing the network into 
partitions, each partition encompassing an immediate neighbour node of the first node on the computed spanning tree and any nodes 
of (he network subtending the neighbour node on the computed spanning tree; merging two or more of the partitions when a 
predetermined criterion is satisfied; examining nodes within all of the partitions except a largest one of the partitions to identify node 
pairs for which a respective shortest path traverses the first node.
