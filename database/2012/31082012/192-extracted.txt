(57) Abstract : 
Methods and apparatus for using a location of a mobile station (MS) and information about neighbor base stations (BSs) to assist 
network entry and initialization, scanning, and/or handover operations are provided. The location of the MS may be ascertained by 
determining the Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinates of the MS internally or by receiving the location from, e.g., a GPS 
device external to the MS. The information about neighbor BSs may be retrieved from a BS information database based on the 
location of the MS. The BS information database may reside within the MS, be broadcast periodically to the MS in an effort to update 
the MSs internal database, or be stored in the network operators database. Knowledge of the MSs location and information about 
neighbor BSs may reduce the time spent during network entry, scanning, or handover, and thereby, power consumption; and may 
increase the bandwidth usage efficiency.
