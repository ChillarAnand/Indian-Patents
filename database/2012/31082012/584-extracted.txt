(57) Abstract : 
The invention relates to a throwable gaming control (710) used in motion controlled games. In particular, the invention relates to 
improving the sensory performance of a throwable gaming control, when the gaming control is actually airborne during a motion 
controlled game. A throwable gaming control for controlling at least one event in a computer game, comprising at least one magnetic 
sensor(110) and at least one acceleration sensor (120) is in accordance with the invention and is characterised in that: at least one 
acceleration sensor(120) is arranged to the center of gravity of the game control and/or to the proximity of the center of gravity of the 
gaming control and at least one magnetic sensor (110) is arranged to a position of least internal magnetic noise, and/or a position of 
low internal magnetic noise.The best mode of the invention is considered to be the combination of an acceleration sensor (120) in the 
centre ofgravity of a wireless spherical mouse that in addition houses a magnetic sensor (110) in a magnetic noise free position. This 
sphericalmouse can be used to play for example basketball with realbasketball like movements in a computer game(70).
