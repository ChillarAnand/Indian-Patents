(57) Abstract : 
Nonwoven fabric having formed on the surface thereof ridges and troughs extending parallel to each other in one direction, the 
nonwoven fabric being configured so that a bodily fluid is prevented from accumulating in the ridges. A nonwoven fabric (1) is 
formed by fusion bonding together short fibers (11) which are thermoplastic synthetic fibers. Ridges (6) and troughs (7) which extend 
parallel to each other are formed on the surface (2) of the nonwoven fabric. The ridges (6) include first ridges (6a), the height of which 
from the rear surface (3) of the nonwoven fabric (1) is large, and second ridges (6b), the height of which is small. The densities of the 
first ridges (6a), the second ridges (6b), and the troughs (7) of the nonwoven fabric (1) are higher in that order. The first ridges (6a) are 
formed so that the density of the first ridges (6a) when the first ridges (6a) are compressed toward the rear surface (3) to have the same 
height as the second ridges (6b) is lower than the density of the second ridges (6b).
