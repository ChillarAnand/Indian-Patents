(57) Abstract : 
The invention relates to a method for producing a strand-like, particularly band like semi-finished part for electrical contacts, wherein 
the semi-finished part has a top side intended for making the electrical contact, said top side made from a silver-based composite 
material in which one or multiple metal oxides or carbon are embedded, and has a carrier layer supporting the composite material 
made of silver or a silver-based alloy, said method having the following steps: - Powder-metallurgic production of a block made from 
the silver-based composite material, - Encasing of the block made of the composite material with a powder made primarily of silver - 
Compressing the block, encased by the metal powder, to condense the metal powder, - Sintering the compressed block, - Reshaping 
the sintered block by extrusion pressing, - Creating a partial strand with a top side made from composite material and a bottom side 
made from silver or a silver-based alloy.
