(57) Abstract : 
A terminal apparatus is disclosed wherein even in a case of applying SU-MIMO and MU-MIMO at the same time, the inter-sequence 
interference in a plurality of pilot signals used by the same terminal can be suppressed to a low value, while the inter-sequence 
interference in pilot signal between terminals can be reduced. In this terminal apparatus (200): a pilot information deciding unit (204) 
decides, based on allocation control information, Walsh sequences of the respective ones of first and second stream groups at least one 
of which includes a plurality of streams; and a pilot signal generating unit (205) forms a transport signal by using the decided Walsh 
sequences to spread the streams included in the first and second stream groups. During this, Walsh sequences orthogonal to each other 
are established in the first and second stream groups, and users are allocated on a stream group-by-stream group basis.
