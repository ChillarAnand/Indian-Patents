Abstract  =>  Disclosed is a polycondensation catalyst for the production of polyesters by an esterification reaction or a transesterification reaction between dicarboxylic acid or an ester-forming derivative of the same, and glycol. In order to obtain the polycondensation catalyst a water-soluble titanium compound is hydrolyzed, in the absence of a water-soluble alkali, in an aqueous slurry having solid base particles dispersed therein, and a coating layer is formed on the surfaces of the solid base particles. The coating layer comprises, in terms of TiO2, 0.1-50 parts by weight of titanic acid per 100 parts by weight of solid bases. Also disclosed are a method for producing the polycondensation catalyst, and polyesters obtained using the polycondensation catalyst.
