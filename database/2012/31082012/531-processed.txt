Abstract  =>  The present invention relates to immunogenic compositions containing an antigen of interest entrapped with a crosslinked carrier protein matrix, methods of making such vaccines, and methods of vaccine administration, wherein the im-munogenicity of the protein matrix, and hence its effectiveness as a vaccine, is improved by controlling or selecting the particle size of the protein matrix particles to eliminate low molecular weight particles, e.g., less than 100 nm in diameter.
