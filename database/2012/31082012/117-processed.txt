Abstract  =>  The present invention relates to a compounds of formula I wherein Ar is aryl; R1 is hydrogen, halogen, lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, lower alkyl substituted by halogen, lower alkoxy substituted by halogen, cyano, amino, mono or di-lower alkyl amino, C(O)-lower alkyl, or is aryl or heteroaryl; R2 is hydrogen or halogen; R3 is -(CH2)p-heterocyclyl, optionally substituted by one or two substituents R4; or is lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, -(CH2)p-O-lower alkyl, -(CH2)P-CN, -O-(CH2)P-CN, -(CH2)p-heteroaiyl, -(CH2)p-C(O) - heteroaiyl, -O-(CH2)p-heterocyclyl, -(CH2)p-aryl, optionally substituted by lower alkoxy or halogen, -(CH2)p-O-aryl, optionally substituted by lower alkyl, -(CH2)p-NR-heterocyclyl, optionally substituted by lower alkyl, -CH2)P-NRR, -CH2)p-NR-CH2)p.-NRR, -CH2)p-NR-CH2)p-CN, -CH2)P-C(O)-NRR or is -O-(CH2)p-NRR; R4 is hydroxy, lower alkyl, -(CH2)p-OH, -(CH2)p-NRR, -NR- C(O)-lower alkyl, -(CH2)P-CN, -S(O)2-lower alkyl, -NR-S(O)2-lower alkyl, -S(O)2-NRR, -C(O)-lower alkyl, -C(O)-lower cycloalkyl, wherein the cycloalkyl may be substituted by lower alkyl, or is -C(O)-NRR, heterocyclyl, optionally substituted by =0, or is heteroaryl, optionally substituted by alkoxy or cyano, or is aryl optionally substituted by alkoxy, cyano or is 2-oxa-5 -aza- bicyclo[2.2.1 ]hept-5 -yl; R and R are independently from each other hydrogen, lower alkyl or -(CH2)p-OH; n is 1 or 2; in case n is 1 or 2, R1 may be the same or different; o is 1 or 2; in case o is 1 or 2, R2 may be the same or different; p,p are the same or different and are 0, 1, 2 3 or 4; or to a pharmaceutically active salt, a racemic mixture, an enantiomer, an optical isomer or a tautomeric form thereof. It has been found that the present compounds are high potential NK-3 receptor antagonists for the treatment of depression, pain, psychosis, Parkinsons disease, schizophrenia, anxiety and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
