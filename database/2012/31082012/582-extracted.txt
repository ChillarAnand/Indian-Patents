(57) Abstract : 
A method of preparing a compound represented by Structural Formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, wherein the 
variables of Structural Formula (I) are as described in the specification and claims, comprises the step of: a) cyclizing a compound 
represented by Structural Formula (A) under suitable reductive cyclisation conditions to form a compound represented by Structural 
Formula (B) wherein R10 is LG1 or -X1R1, and -LG1 is a suitable leaving group; and b) optionally, when R10 of Structural Formula 
(B) is LG1, further comprising the step of replacing the -LG1 of Structural Formula (B) with -X1R1 to form the compound 
represented by Structural Formula (I).
