Abstract  =>  Maintaining data in a data management system (10) including at least one processor and a storage system (150) includes accessing a first data source (130) providing one or more source elements of data; accessing a storage system (120) storing one or more subsets of data, each subset including at least one element of data, and storing one or more descriptors identifying a data source for a subset and identifying a data source for each of one or more elements of the subset; and processing rules that determine if, according to the descriptors, an element in the storage system is allowed to be changed.
