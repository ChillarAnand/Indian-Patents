Abstract  =>  The invention concerns a supercharger that has two rotors engaging into each other and is provided with a disc clutch. The disc clutch has driving (9) and driven (12) clutches connected with a drive shaft (7) and with one of the rotors, respectively. Furthermore, there is an axially displaceable pressing body (15) as well as actuation device (13) for the same and a deactuation spring (17). According to the invention, the disc clutch comprises a stop device (18, 19) that limits the axial movement of the pressing body (15) in the deactuation direction. The stop device (18, 19) consists of an impact means (18) on the pressing body (15) or on the driven clutch holder (11) and a stop means (19) on the other component. The impact means (18) is axially fixed while the stop means (19) is attached by a friction joint.
