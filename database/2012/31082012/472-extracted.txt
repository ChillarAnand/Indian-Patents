(57) Abstract : 
A targeted-content-message-related profile for use with wireless access terminals (W-ATs) may be generated by one or more usage-
related rules on the W-AT itself. The usage generate rules may be used by the W-AT to generate a user profile, with the usage-related 
rule providing a dynamic property to the user profile. All or part of the user profile may then be used as a targeted-content-message-
related profile for targeting content messages.
