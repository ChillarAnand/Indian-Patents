Abstract  =>  Method for depositing a thin film comprising: - providing an expanding thermal plasma plume (116), including at least one chemical component to be deposited; - designating a first (130a) and a second (130c) deposition zone within the plasma plume, such that the first and second deposition zones have a mutually different relative content of the chemical component; - providing a substrate (120), and transporting said substrate through the plasma plume along a substrate transport path (126) having a substrate transport path direction (T); and - providing a mask (128) that is at least partly disposed in the plasma plume and that shields a portion of the substrate transport path from being deposited on, wherein said shielded portion of the substrate transport path extends in the direction of the substrate transport path and bridges at least the first deposition zone, while it starts or terminates in the second deposition zone.
