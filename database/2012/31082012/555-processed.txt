Abstract  =>  A radio base station wherein when UE connected to an LTE access network performs a CS Fallback, the time required for the CS Fallback can be reduced. An eNB (100), which moves in a cell providing a first service and further covers a cell providing a second service different from the first service, gives UE, which is currently connected to the eNB, an instruction of handover to the cell providing the first service. In the eNB: a terminal position predicting unit (103) predicts, based on the position, moving speed or traveling direction of the UE, a position of the UE at the handover timing; a determining unit (105) determines, based on the position of the UE at the handover timing, a handover destination of the UE from among a plurality of cells providing the first services; and an instructing unit (106) transmits, to the UE, a handover instruction that is an instruction of handover to the cell of the handover destination.
