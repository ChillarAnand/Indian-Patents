Abstract  =>  A power management apparatus for a hybridized energy device includes a hybridized energy device including a plurality of units. The units include electrical energy storage and/or gathering cells, in series or in parallel to form a module. A plurality of the modules in series or in parallel form a pack. The power management apparatus also includes a central management apparatus (CMA) interconnecting a plurality of module management apparatus (MMAs) by means of either wired or wireless connections and a plurality of MMAs. Each - MMA interconnects with a plurality of unit management apparatuses by means of either wireless or wired communication circuits. The power management apparatus further includes a plurality of units management apparatuses (UMAs), each wired, connected with, or deposited on a unit. Furthermore, the power management apparatus includes a rechargeable battery power source for a CMA, a plurality of MMAs, and a plurality of UMAs.
