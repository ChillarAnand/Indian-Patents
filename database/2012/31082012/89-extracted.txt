This method comprises the following steps: - carrying out a processing of the specimen, said processing being carried out so as to 
make it possible to differentiate the pathological cells from the healthy cells of the specimen, - performing an acquisition of images of 
the specimen disposed on the analysis plate so as to obtain a plurality of images each representing a zone of the analysis plate, said 
images placed side by side forming an image of the whole of the specimen so as to create a virtual analysis plate. The method 
furthermore comprises the following step: - performing on the virtual analysis plate a processing of the images acquired so as to obtain 
a virtual restitution of the colors and of the intensity of the colors of the cytoplasm and/or of the nucleus, said colors and said intensity
