(57) Abstract : 
A support device (100) and a main building of a concrete mixing plant using the same are provided. The support device (100) 
comprises: a first support bar (2) having a first end (21) connected to a first supported body (13), a second support bar (7) having a 
first end (71) connected to a second supported body (12), an adjusting bar (6) having opposite threads on both ends and respectively 
threadedly connected to a second end (22) of the first support bar (2) and a second end (72) of the second support bar (7). The 
adjusting bar (6) is arranged between the first support bar (2) and the second support bar (7) in the support device (100), and rotation 
directions of the threads on two ends of the adjusting bar (6) are different, hence when the adjusting bar (6) is rotated, the first support 
bar (2) and the second support bar (7) can be screwed in or out simultaneously in order to adapt different support distances to make up 
for a problem of a major error deviation in an actual installation process.
