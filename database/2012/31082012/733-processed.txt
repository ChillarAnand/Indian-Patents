Abstract  =>  Spout for a Spill-Proof Beverage Container A spout is disclosed for a spill-proof beverage container. The spout 12 having a side wall made of a flexible material defining an outer surface to be contacted by the lips of a drinker and an inner surface defining a discharge passage leading to a mouth of the spout to permit a beverage to sucked from the container by the drinker. A valve is provided in the discharge passage to prevent undesired spillage of the beverage when no person is drinking from the cup. The valve comprises two flanks 16a, 16b formed integrally with the side wall 18 of the spout 12 and projecting from opposite sides of the inner surface of the spout. The front end faces of the flanks mate with one another along a slit 30 that extends generally parallel to the longer axis of the spout so that the two flanks form a continuous surface obstructing the discharge passage when the slit 30 is closed. At least the front portions of the flanks are inclined away from the mouth of the spout 12 such that pressure within the container acts to urge the flanks 16a, 16b against one another so as to maintain the slit 30 closed. Deformation of the side wall 18 of the spout 12 when the spout is held between the lips of a drinker acts to open the slit 30 and create an opening between the flanks to allow the beverage to be discharged.
