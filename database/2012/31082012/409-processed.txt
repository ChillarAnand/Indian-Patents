Abstract  =>  A process for hydrocarbon conversion, comprising: contacting a hydrocarbon with an acid catalyst containing greater than 15 wt% conjunct polymer. The acid catalyst has a molar ratio of Al to a heteroatom selected from the group of N, P, O, S, and combinations thereof greater than 2.0. The hydrocarbon is converted during the contacting. Also a method to make a catalyst having greater than 15 wt% conjunct polymer and a high molar ratio of Al to the heteroatom, wherein an acidic ionic liquid catalyst is made that is effective for catalyzing a reaction. There are also provided catalyst compositions having greater than 15 wt% conjunct polymer.
