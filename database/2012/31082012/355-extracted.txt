(57) Abstract : 
This patent work is based on the diesel engine that works on single stroke, which produces power for every 180Â° revolution of crank. 
The combustion occurs on both sides of the piston. The engine cylinder and piston is sealed on both sides to avoid leakage. The 
sealing is made by expandable ring in the piston and compression ring in the bottom of the cylinder. The connecting rod moves in a 
reciprocating motion and does not oscillate.This linear motion of the piston is converted into rotary motion in crank shaft by a 
connecting rod withsliding mechanism. The engine produces relatively more power than any other reciprocating engine. The Power to 
Weight ratio for this engine is high.
