(57) Abstract : 
A method for the activation of CdTe films used in CdTe/CdS type thin film solar cells, in which a CdTe film is treated with a mixture 
formed by a fluorine-free chlorinated hydrocarbon and a gaseous chlorine-free fluorinated hydrocarbon, both said compounds being 
harmless to the ozone layer. In particular, the chlorinated hydrocarbon is 1-chlorobutane, 1,1,2-trichloroethylene or dichloromethane 
and the fluorinated hydrocarbon is 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane, trifluoromethane or 1,1- difluoromethane.
