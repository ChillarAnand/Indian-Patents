(57) Abstract : 
The present invention concerns the method for preparation of europium chalcogenide thin films, deposited by spray pyrolysis. 
Formation of thin films is based on a general formula, Ra-Cb, wherein R represents the europium and C represent a chalcogen, a and b 
represents the proportions of europium and chalcogen respectively. The method comprises, pyrolysis of liquid precursor of said 
europium (R) and a chalcogen (C) or liquid precursor of said euporium (R) and at least one liquid precursor of said chalcogen (C), 
prepared in aqueous and non-aqueous solvent mediums. The liquid precursor is sprayed on hot substrate, with pre-determined 
parameters like substrate temperature, precursor concentration, precursor composition, nozzle to substrate distance, spray rate, carrier 
gas flow rate and pressure on the carrier gas. Scientifically important thin films of comparatively thin in thickness and of good 
morphological characteristics are synthesized.
