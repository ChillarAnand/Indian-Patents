The present invention pertains, at least in part, to novel 9-substituted minocycline compounds. These minocyline compounds can be 
used to treat numerous tetracycline compound-responsive states, such as bacterial infections and neoplasms, as well as other known 
applications for minocycline and tetracycline compounds in general, such as blocking tetracycline compounds in general, such as 
blocking tetracycline efflux and modulation of gene expression.
