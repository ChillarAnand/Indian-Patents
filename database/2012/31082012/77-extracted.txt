(57) Abstract : 
A facet joint prosthesis comprises a pair of facet elements for engaging the superior and inferior articular processes of a facet joint. 
The facet elements are provided with one or more articulating surfaces for articulating movement there-between. The facet elements 
are also provided with a positive engagement means for preventing separation of the elements and/or to limit relative movement there-
between within a pre-determined range. In one aspect, the invention provides a spacer for positioning between the facet elements and 
for distracting the facet joint. The spacer may also serve to form an artificial lateral mass between the superior and inferior articulating 
surfaces. The spacer may be provided with engagement means for positively engaging one or both of the facet elements.
