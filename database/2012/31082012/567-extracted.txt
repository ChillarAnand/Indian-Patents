(57) Abstract : 
The present invention provides a convenient and cost-effective process for preparation of chiral intermediates through asymmetric 
reduction of ketones. The process comprises reaction of achiral ketone with the reagent prepared from sodium borohydride, N,N 
diethylaniline hydrochloride, and optically active α, α-diphenyl-2-pyrrolidinyl methanol. The chiral intermediates so prepared possess 
high enantiomeric purity and are used as intermediates in synthesis of active pharmaceutical ingredients such as Dapoxetine, 
Fluoxetine, Atomoxetine, Duloxetine, and Rivastigmine.
