material is digested for an hour and filtered through standard filter paper, the same is oxidised in crucible till white ash is obtained, in 
which concentrated nitric acid is added in presence of catalyst to obtain silver nitrate; which is further treated with alkali citrate 
solution and heating it till pale yellow colour is appears which indicates formation of silver nanoparticles which is further characterise 
by using analytical techniques,
