(57) Abstract : 
A wireless radio communication system for communicating packet transmissions from a base station to a mobile unit, comprising: a 
relay station positioned between the base station and the mobile unit, said relay station having a relaying function in a multihop packet 
transmission from the base station to the mobile unit and the relay station configured to perform communication based on a wireless 
packet transmission protocol, wherein said relay station receives an information packet transmission from the base station, said 
information packet transmission received by the relay station has a control region, a data region, and a common reference signal for 
use in decoding the information packet transmission, said relay station transmitting the control signal and the common reference signal 
in the control region of a multihop packet transmission from the relay station to the mobile unit so the mobile unit can conduct channel 
measurement and estimation analysis of packet transmissions received from the relay station.
