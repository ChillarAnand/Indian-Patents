A static or non-moving part electric power generator achieved by a changing (fluctuating) magnetic field (flux) by passing a pulsating 
direct current (DC) through a coil of wire wound on either a magnet or any material capable of producing a magnetic field, which in 
turn induces an alternating current (AC) in an adjacent secondary coil winding, and wherein a portion of the AC produced is used in 
recharging a DC source.
