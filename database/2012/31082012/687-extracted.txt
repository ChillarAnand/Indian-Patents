(57) Abstract : 
A three dimensional woven preform, a fiber reinforced composite incorporating the preform, and methods of making thereof are 
disclosed. The woven preform includes two or more warp steered fabrics. The warp steered fabrics include a darted portion and an un-
darted portion. The darted portions of the warp steered fabrics are joined to un-darted portions of one another so as to provide 
continuous fiber in the circumferential and radial directions of all portions of the preform. An un-darted portion in one steered fabric 
reinforces a darted portion in the other. The warp steered fabrics can be woven on a loom equipped with a differential take-up 
mechanism. The warp steered fabrics can be single or multilayer fabrics. The final preform can be a portion of an aircraft window 
frame.
