Abstract  =>  The present invention relates to a hydraulic and electronic based power lifting system that enables desired controlled lifting or lowering of implement hitched to three point linkage of the tractor to an adjustable height, wherein the operator can pre-set the lifting height of the implement to any desired value, just enough to clear the ground. The synergistic hydraulic and electronic combination and configuration of the this quick-lift sub-assembly, valve block, cylinder assembled with the rockshaft and the control lever working in tandem with each other enables the operator to set and select extent of rotation of the rockshaft enabling quick implement lifting / lowering by desired extent just enough to clear ground in the field resulting in productivity / utilization enhancement of the off-road vehicle such as tractor.
