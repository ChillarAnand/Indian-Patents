(57) Abstract : 
The present invention relates to the processing of dental ceramic crowns and bridges which are to be placed in a patients oral cavity to 
replace damaged or missing teeth. To prepare the framework structure of dental crown or bridge, ceramic powder blends are infiltrated 
with glass. The process involves fabrication of porous ceramic performs using engineered particle size distribution. The particle size 
distributions result in a characteristic pore size distribution which facilitates infiltration of glass in the presintered porous bodies in 
shortest possible time. Thereby getting a dental ceramic product with enhanced fracture toughness and strength.
