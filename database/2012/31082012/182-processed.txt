Abstract  =>  Techniques for designing a single-balanced mixer coupled to a dummy portion with a dummy load to improve noise rejection. In an aspect, a single-ended signal (RF) from a stage preceding the mixer, e.g., a low-noise amplifier (LNA), is coupled to the input of the single-balanced mixer to be mixed with a local oscillator (LO) signal. A dummy portion replicating the topology of the single- balanced mixer is coupled to the single-balanced mixer to improve noise rejection, with the LO signal also provided to the dummy portion. The input of the dummy portion may be coupled, e.g., to a dummy load, which is designed to replicate the loading characteristics of the preceding stage, e.g., the LNA.
