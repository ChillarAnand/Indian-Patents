(57) Abstract : 
The present invention relates to a system and a method for the production, filling, packaging and / or transport of beverages in 
beverage containers. The system components are coupled physically and by a common control unit. Furthermore the system 
components are coupled at least partially energetically. The system components form mutually coupled energy conversion units, 
energy storage units and / or energy consumption units. The system components are provided with energy from one common energy 
generating device, which supplies mechanical operating power (wave energy) and / or electrical energy and / or thermal energy to the 
system components.
