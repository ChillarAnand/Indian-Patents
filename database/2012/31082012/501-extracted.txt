The present invention to a process for preparing 1-phenylpyrazoles of the formula I in which each R1 is independently selected from 
chlorine, fluorine, alkyl, haloalkyl, alkoxy and haloalkoxy;n is 1, 2 or 3;each R2 is independently selected from cyano, nitro, halogen, 
alkyl, haloalkyl,alkoxy, haloalkoxy,alkylthio and alkoxycarbonyl; mis 0, 1 or 2;A is alkyl, aryl or aryl-C1-C4-alkyl, where A 
optionally bears 1, 2, 3 or 4 substituents comprising reacting a phenyl halide of the formula (II) with apyrazole derivative of the 
formula (III) in which X is chlorine, iodine or bromine; and R1, n, R2, m and A are each as defined above, in the presence of a base
