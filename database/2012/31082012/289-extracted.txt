(57) Abstract : 
An unwinding device (10) is described for unwinding rolls (12, 14) of one-ply or two-ply web- like material (24). The device (10) 
comprises: a support group for sustaining a first roll (12) and a second roll (14), the support group being composed of a support pin 
(16) for each roll (12, 14), the support pins (16) being bound on two opposite sides of a vertical column (18) made integral with the 
base (20) of the unwinding device (10); an unwinding mechanism (22) for each roll (12, 14), adapted to unwind the web- like material 
(24) from the rolls (12, 14); a joining mechanism (26), adapted to join specific web-like material portions (24) together that 
respectively come from the first roll (12) and from the second roll (14). One of the support pins (16) is bound to the vertical column 
(18) at a height (Hi), measured with respect to the base (20), that is different from the height (H2) of the second support pin (16) 
bound on the opposite side of the vertical column (18), so as to limit the thickness of the vertical column (18) along with the width of 
the unwinding device (10) as much as possible.
