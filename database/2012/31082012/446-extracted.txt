(57) Abstract : 
Bioactive substances are imbedded or mixed into functionalized matrices to form homogenous water-insoluble solid complexes with 
desirable field properties such as reduced leaching in soil, improved leaf retention, selective unloading to roots and convenient 
packaging and application. Bioactive substances of this disclosure include pharmaceutical agents and pesticides including herbicides, 
insecticides, bacteriocides, rodenticides, nematicide and fungicides. The matrices comprise a monomeric-, oligomeric- or 
(co)polymeric backbone which may be derivatized with chemical groups exhibiting ionic (amines, carboxyls), hydrophobic, and 
ligandbinding interactions to form the matrix of the formulation. The various matrices may be mixed with additives or modifiers, 
grafted, or fused to obtain optimal properties. The formulations may be applied as granules, suspensions, emulsions in sprays, foams, 
or coats for seeds and fertilizers. Alternatively they may be melted and sprayed as concentrates. The formulations may be applied to 
foliage, soil, irrigation water, construction materials, seeding materials, grains, and buildings.
