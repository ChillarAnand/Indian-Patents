Abstract  =>  An apparatus for detecting an object capable of emitting light. The apparatus includes a light source (102) and a waveguide (110). The waveguide (110) includes a core layer (112) and a first cladding layer (114). At least one nanowell (120) is formed in at least the first cladding layer (114). The apparatus further includes a light detector (106). The light detector (106) can detect light emitted from a single molecule object contained in the at least one nanowell (120).
