(57) Abstract : 
The present invention relates to button covers to be used as clothing accessories. These button covers can be made of precious or non-
precious metals and can be embedded with precious or semi-precious stones to enhance the beauty of the button. The button cover has 
a slider attached to it which secures the cover from below the button. The slider in this invention is based on a spring tension clasping 
system which gives it strength and longetivity. These button covers can be wore on the sleeves in place of cuff links. Some men also 
wear a button cover at the top button on the collar and in this way replace them with ties. The present invention provides security in 
terms of an elaborate locking system due to which there are negligible chances of the button cover falling off.
