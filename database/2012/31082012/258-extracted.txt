(57) Abstract : 
The present invention relates to copolymers obtainable by free-radical polymerization of i) 10% to 90% by weight, based on the total 
weight of components i to iv, of at least one monomer selected from the group consisting of a C8-C30 alkyl (meth)acrylate, C8-C30 
vinyl ester, C8-C30 vinyl ether, C8-C30 olefin, and triglyceride of unsaturated C8-C30 carboxylic acids; ii) 0.5% to 70% by weight, 
based on the total weight of components i to iv, of a double-bond-containing monomer having at least one epoxide, isocyanate, car- 
bodiimide, silane, Î²-dicarbonyl, oxazoline, or anhydride group; iii) 0% to 75% by weight, based on the total weright of components i 
to iv, of one or more monomers selected from the group consisting of vinylaromatic, C1-C7-alkyl (meth)acrylate, ethylenically 
unsaturated acetophenone derivative or benzophe- none derivative, C1-C7 vinyl ester, C1-C7 vinyl ether, ethylenically unsaturated ni-
trile, ethylenically unsaturated amide, vinyl halide, C2-C7 olefin, cyclic lactam, and mixtures of these monomers; and iv) 0% to 10% 
by weight, based on the total weight of components i to iv, of a free- radically polymerizable monomer with carboxylic acid, sulfonic 
acid or phos- phonic acid groups or salts thereof. The invention further relates to polymer mixtures comprising these copolymers and 
also to the use of the copolymers as chain extenders, compatlbilizers and/or hydrolysis stabilizers, to produce paper and cardboard, for 
surface finishing in the paper, textile, and leather industries, and in adhesives.
