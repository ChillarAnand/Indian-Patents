(57) Abstract : 
Non-woven mat including magnesium aluminum silicate glass fibers and amorphous refractory ceramic fibers, bio-soluble ceramic 
fibers, and/or heat-treated silica fibers. Embodiments of the nonwoven mat surprisingly have a Resiliency Value after three thermal 
cycles from 25°C to 700°C/400°C of the Real Condition Fixture Test at least 1.1 times greater than the Resiliency Value of a 
comparable non-woven mat consisting of any individual type of fibers of the non-woven mat. The non-woven mats are useful, for 
example, in pollution control devices and other thermal insulation applications.
