(57) Abstract : 
Methods and apparatus related to partitioning traffic segments are described. An access router, having concurrent connections with 
two access terminals and desiring to transmit traffic signals to the two access terminals in the same traffic segment, partitions a traffic 
segment. The partition is such that a first portion of the traffic segment is allocated to a first access terminal and a second portion of 
the traffic segment is allocated to the second access terminal. Control information, e.g., identifying partition portion assignments, data 
rate and/or coding information, is also communicated in the traffic segment as in-band control signaling. An access terminal, to which 
some of traffic signals are directed, receives and recovers the in-band control signaling, identifying its allocated partition portion of 
the traffic segment and identifying data rate and/or coding information used. The access terminal receives the traffic segment signals 
in its allocated partition portion and recovers the traffic information.
