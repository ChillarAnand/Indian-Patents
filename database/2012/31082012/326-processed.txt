Abstract  =>  In an preferred mode of the invention aromatic carboxylic acid in water and neutralizing with base till clear solution is obtained which is used as prepare reaction mixture to digest silver containing waste material to obtain salt of the aromatic carboxylic acid, the waste material is digested for an hour and filtered through standard filter paper, the same is oxidised in crucible till white ash is obtained, in which concentrated nitric acid is added in presence of catalyst to obtain silver nitrate; which is further treated with alkali citrate solution and heating it till pale yellow colour is appears which indicates formation of silver nanoparticles which is further characterise by using analytical techniques,
