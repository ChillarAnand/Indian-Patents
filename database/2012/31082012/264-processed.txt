Abstract  =>  Exemplary embodiments are directed to reducing jamming caused by radiated fields generated by wireless power transmitters. Exemplary embodiments include detecting a jamming condition of a wireless power receiving device resulting from a radiated field from a wireless power transmitter of a charging device. Such embodiments include synchronizing the wireless power coupling with communication of the wireless power receiving device. Synchronizing wireless power coupling may include wireless power coupling at a first level when the wireless power receiving device is expected to receive a signal on a communication channel. Synchronizing wireless power coupling may further include coupling at a higher rate when the wireless power receiving device is not expected to receive a signal on the communication channel.
