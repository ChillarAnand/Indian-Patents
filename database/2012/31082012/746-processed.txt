Abstract  =>  The invention relates to an integrated collector-accumulator system that enables capture and accumulation in the same essentially cylindrical capturing-accumulating element (2), that receives solar light via an insulting transparent cover (4), partly directly and partly be reflection over reflective screens (1) having an essentially circular cross section, where the rotational axes thereof are located in the contour of the jacket of the capturing-accumulating element (2) or inside same. The system also comprises an outer shell (6) that, together with the transparent cover (4), completely envelopes the system, and a thermal insulating material layer (5) between the reflective screens (1) and the outer shell (6), that essentially reduces the heat loss. Said characteristics enable the system to be produced in a very simple and economic manner, due to the savings in material, work force, and production technology necessary for the materalisation thereof, in addition to a high yield of heating when it is ensured that all of the light incident on the transparent cover (4), whether it be direct, indirect or at any angle of incidence, is absorbed by the capturing-accumulating element (2).
