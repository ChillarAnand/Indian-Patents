(57) Abstract : 
The invention relates to a secondary packaging (10), comprising at least two articles connected to each other, such as PET containers 
(12), which are held together by means of at least one tape- or strip-shaped, closed strap (18) that is tensioned horizontally around an 
outer face (16) of the articles or PET containers (12). The strap is formed by means of one, two or more identical or different tapes 
(20) made of plastic or a composite material, which at the ends thereof are glued and/or welded to each other in an overlapping 
manner forming an integral or multi-part contact point (22). At the contact point (22), or removed therefrom, at least one relief loop 
(30) is designed on the strap (18). The invention further relates to a method for producing a secondary packaging that is provided with 
a strap (18), which is applied using the following steps: inserting the tape (20) in a frame that is placed around the secondary 
packaging (10), clamping the tape (20) in at least one point, forming a relief loop (30) in the direct vicinity of the clamping point, 
pulling back the non-clamped tape section and tensioning the tape (20), clamping the tape sections in the region of the relief loop (30),
welding the tape sections located one on top of the other, and releasing the strap tape (18).
