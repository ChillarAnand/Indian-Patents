Abstract  =>  Processes and compositions for liposomal delivery of therapeuticals prepared by contacting an aqueous solution of an active agent with a solution of liposome-forming components containing one or more DILA2 amino acid compounds or lipids in organic solvent to form an impinging stream. A protocol including flow rates, pH, and an incubation period are used to control formation of liposomal components for therapeutic applications. The impinging stream may be collected and incubated to prepare a liposomal formulation which encapsulates the active agent. The composition can be quenched with buffer and filtered by tangential flow and diafiltration and other means for finishing as a pharmaceutical composition. An efficiency for delivering a drug cargo is provided. Compositions can include a liposome containing one or more carrier particles, each carrier particle having an active agent and a peptide, wherein the ratio of the mass of the peptide plus the mass of the liposome to the mass of the active agent is less than about 15.
