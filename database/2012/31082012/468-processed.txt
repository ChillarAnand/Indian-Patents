Abstract  =>  In an embodiment, a peripheral component configured to control an external interface of an integrated circuit. For example, the peripheral component may be a memory interface unit such as a flash memory interface unit. The internal interface to the peripheral component may be shared between data transfers to/from the external interface and control communications to the peripheral component. The peripheral component may include a command queue configured to store a set of commands to perform a transfer on the interface. A control circuit may be coupled to the command queue and may read the commands and communicate with an interface controller to cause a transfer on the interface responsive to the commands. In an embodiment, a macro memory may store command sequences to be performed in response to a macro command in the command queue. In an embodiment, an operand queue may store operand data for use by the commands.
