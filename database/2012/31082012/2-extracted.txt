The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of a 4,5-diamino shikimic acid derivative of formula I and 
pharmaceutically acceptable addition salts thereof wherein R1, R1 are independent of each other H or alkyl, R2 is an alkyl and R3,R4 
are independent of each other H or an alkanoyl, with the proviso that not both R3 and R4 are H. 4,5-diamino shikimic acid derivatives 
of formula I, especially the (3R,4R,5S)-5-amino-4-acetylamino-3-(1-ethyl-propoxy)-cyclohex-l-ene-carboxylic add ethyl ester and its 
pharmaceutically acceptable additional salts are potent inhibitors of viral neuraminidase.
