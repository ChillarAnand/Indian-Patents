(57) Abstract : 
The invention relates to a filter for filtering fluids, in particular gases, more particularly intake air, fuel, urea solution or engine oil, 
particularly of an internal combustion engine, particularly of a motor vehicle, or ambient air for introduction into ventilation systems 
of buildings or vehicles, comprising a filter element (1) made of a filter medium (106) pleated in a zigzag manner, with a raw side 
(105) and a clean side (104). On the raw side (105), a plurality of elongated depressions (656) are formed in the filter medium (14; 
106), which extend between raw-side pleat tips (102a) and raw-side pleat bases (103a) approximately perpendicular to pleat edges (F) 
of the filter medium (106) and implement corresponding elevations (658) on the clean side (104) such that, in a raw-side pleat 
intermediate space (148a), in each case, two depressions (656) on the two medium sections (120) delimiting the pleat intermediate 
space (148a) are located directly opposite of each other and each form a flow channel (660).
