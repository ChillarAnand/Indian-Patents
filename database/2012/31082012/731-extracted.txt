(57) Abstract : 
Provided is a boring tool which not only is lightweight but also has both abrasion resistance and high stiffness. More specifically, 
provided is a boring tool wherein a shaft-like tool body (10) is equipped with cutting bits, and wherein the tool body (10) makes a 
reciprocating motion, thereby reaming a hole provided to a workpiece to be machined. The tool body (10) is provided with a substrate 
(11) formed by a carbon fiber reinforced composite material, a hard plating layer (13) consisting of hard plating applied to the surface 
(10b) of the tool body (10), and a backing layer (12) which is applied between the substrate (11) and the hard plating layer (13) and 
serves to improve the wettability of the hard plating layer (13).
