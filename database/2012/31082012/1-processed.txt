Abstract  =>  A system using cooperative communication with rateless codes is presented that uses communication transmission aspects of cooperative communication with rateless codes over Rayleigh fading channels and queuing aspects for buffering messages at intermediate relays. The system transmits a subsequent message while a current message is en route to the destination by receiving and buffering the current message in queues at intermediate relays. A relay with a best instantaneous communication link to the source may receive a message first and forward the received message to the destination. Alternatively, if inter-relay communication links are strong, all relays may cooperate simultaneously.
