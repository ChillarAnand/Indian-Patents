Abstract  =>  The present invention relates to an image processing device and method, and a program, whereby a subject image imaged in a more effective manner can be displayed. An imaging apparatus 11 images multiple imaged images P(1) through P(N) in a state turning with a turning center C11 as the center. The imaging apparatus 11 trims from each of the obtained multiple imaged images a region determined by a predetermined reference position in the imaged image as a strip-of-paper image, and arrays and synthesizes these strip-of-paper images, thereby generating a panorama image with a predetermined region on imaging space as a subject. The imaging apparatus 11 generates multiple panorama images while shifting a trimming position of a strip-of-paper image from the imaged image, thereby obtaining a panorama moving image made up of the multiple panorama images. According to this panorama moving image, a subject in an imaged image can be displayed with motion. The present invention can be applied to cameras.
