Abstract  =>  Pot tending machine (3) for a series of electrolysis cells (2) designed for the production of aluminum by igneous electrolysis including: a) an overhead traveling crane (4) which can be relocated above said electrolysis cells, b) a tool carriage (6) onto which is fixed a service module comprising tools (10); c) a tapping winch (13), interdependent of said overhead traveling crane, designed to grasp and position near cell (2) a tapping assembly including a ladle (40), a tapping tube (41) and a vacuum device; d) a freestanding device (50, 50) able to generate compressed air; characterized in that said compressed air generating device of includes a first compressor (50), able to provide a flow of compressed air at least equal to the minimum air flow necessary for operations other than tapping, and at least one second compressor (50) mounted in such a way that, when operating simultaneously with said first compressor, the unit provides a flow of compressed air at least equal to the minimum output of air necessary during tapping.
