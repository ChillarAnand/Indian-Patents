Abstract  =>  A process is disclosed including: contacting solid biomass with a first catalyst stream in a first reaction zone operated at a temperature T1 (from about 250 to about 400Â°C), for conversion of a portion of the solid biomass and forming a first gaseous product stream; downwardly passing unconverted biomass to a second reaction zone for contact with a second catalyst stream charged to the second reaction zone operated at a temperature T2, for conversion to form a second gaseous product stream and a spent catalyst; burning coke off the spent catalyst in a regenerator to form a regenerated catalyst; charging a portion of the regenerated catalyst to each of the first and second reaction zones, as the first and second catalyst streams, respectively; upwardly passing the second gaseous product stream to the first reaction zone; and removing both first and second gaseous product streams from the first reaction zone.
