(57) Abstract : 
Upon start of processing, a digital broadcast receiver can acquire a CDN configuration information file (XML) after newly connected 
to a CDN by a users operation. Next, the digital broadcast receiver acquires a PF configuration information file written in the CDN 
configuration information. The digital broadcast receiver judges whether there is an IP broadcast or not. If there is an IP broadcast, the 
digital broadcast receiver connects to a multicast address described in the PF configuration information file (XML), and acquires 
information on all channels in the PF from a SI dedicated stream (all station SI including no video or audio) (channel scan). The URL 
of a SNTP is described in the CDN configuration information file. Time information is acquired through the SNTP at the same time as 
(or at a timing near the timing of, such as immediately before or immediately after) the channel scan. The above processing enables 
easy time acquisition which is a problem peculiar to an IPTV with which viewing of an IP broadcast is possible.
