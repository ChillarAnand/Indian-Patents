(57) Abstract : 
The present invention relates to a device for electric connection between the foot of a bimetal strip and a contact strip in an electric 
switchgear apparatus, said bimetal strip being able to be moved by means of an adjustment screw so as to perform thermal adjustment 
of the bimetal strip, this device being characterized in that it comprises a flattened conductive part (6) fixed on the one hand on the 
contact strip (1) and on the other hand on the bimetal strip (2), said part being formed by at least one continuous conductive element 
wound and then flattened so as to give the latter both a length corresponding substantially to the distance separating the foot of the 
bimetal strip and the contact strip and a semi-rigid structure enabling it to deform under the effect of adjustment of the adjustment 
screw (7) so as to allow movement of the bimetal strip (2) while at the same time being sufficiently rigid to ensure relative placement 
of the foot of the bimetal strip with respect to the contact strip.
