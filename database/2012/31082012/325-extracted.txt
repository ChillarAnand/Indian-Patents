(57) Abstract : 
The present invention provides a device for measuring, processing and evaluating medicinal parameters relating to human body, the 
device comprising: means for measuring transcutaneous carbon dioxide tension (tcPCo2) transcutaneous oxygen tension (PO2), pulse 
oximetric saturation (Sp02) and blood pH of the subject human body; means for processing the data relating to the transcutaneous 
carbon dioxide tension (tcPCo2), transcutaneous oxygen tension (PO2), pulse oximetric saturation (Sp,02) and blood pH obtained 
from the means for measuring; means for obtaining first ayurvedic clinical parameter (VgtC-O) based on the processed data, the first 
ayurvedic clinical parameter (VgtC-O) indicates ayurvedic vata gati carbon oxygen relationship and evaluates ayurvedic VATA 
Dosha in the subject human body; means for obtaining second ayurvedic clinical parameter (AgkH) based on the first ayurvedic 
clinical parameter (VgtC-O) where the second ayurvedic clinical parameter (AgkH) indicates level of hydrogen ion in the body and 
accordingly heat energy level in the body, the second ayurvedic clinical parameter (AgkH) evaluates ayurvedic PITTA Dosha in the 
subject human body; means for obtaining third ayurvedic clinical parameter (SHplHC-O) based on the processed data where the third 
ayurvedic clinical parameter (SHplHC-O) indicates level of bicarbonic acid bicarbonates in the body and accordingly viscosity 
producing level of blood and body fluids, where the third ayurvedic clinical parameter (SHplHC-O) evaluates ayurvedic KAPHA 
Dosha in the subject human body; means for obtaining fourth ayurvedic clinical parameter (Agkm) based on the processed data, the 
fourth ayurvedic clinical parameter (Agkm) indicates hydrogen ion concentration in ayrvedic terminology; means for obtaining fifth 
ayurvedic clinical parameter (SmO-O) based on the proceesed data, the fifth ayurvedic clinical parameter (SmO-O) indicates water 
oxygen relationship in ayurvedic terminology; a database including a table illustrating relationship among abnormality and/or disease 
in the subject human body and at least one of the ayurvedic clinical parameters; means for obtaining sixth ayurvedic clinical parameter 
(Tdh) based on the processed data, the sixth ayurvedic clinical parameter (Tdh) indicates hydrogen ion concentration in ayurvedic 
terminology and quantitative range of total dhatus in the subject human body; means for evaluating the affected body part or disease 
based on the at least one of the ayurvedic clinical parameter and the data given in the table; and display unit for displaying the 
measured values of transcutaneous carbon dioxide tension (tcPCo2), transcutaneous oxygen tension (PO2), pulse oximetric saturation 
(Spo2) and blood pH, values of the first ayurvedic clinical parameter (VgtC-O), the second ayurvedic clinical parameter (AgkH), the 
third ayurvedic clinical parameter (SHplHC-O), the fourth ayurvedic clinical parameter (Agkm), the fifth ayurvedic clinical parameter 
(SmO-O), the sixth ayurvedic clinical parameter (Tdh), the data given in the table and information showing the affected body part or 
disease in the subject human body.
