(57) Abstract : 
The inventors have examined the means for providing more efficacious gene expression blocking compounds. The inventors have 
discovered new structural features that surprisingly improve the efficacy of gene expression blocking molecules. These features 
include the presence of multiple 3 ends and a linker at the 5 ends. Surprisingly, these features improve the efficacy of the gene 
expression blocking compounds in a manner that decreases the compounds biologic instability. Even more surprisingly, this effect has 
been found to be applicable to both DNA and RNA oligonucleotide -based compounds and to have application in traditional antisense 
and RNAi technologies.
