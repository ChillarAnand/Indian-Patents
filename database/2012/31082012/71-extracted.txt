(57) Abstract : 
The present subject matter relates to a method and a device (2) for testing a functional soundness of at least one injection valve (10) of 
an internal combustion engine (8). The device (2) carries out a test of at least the functional soundness of a lambda probe (12) adapted 
to determine a state of the at least one injection valve (10). For this, a steady- state operating condition of the internal combustion 
engine (8) is established and a test is performed to see whether at least one signal of the lambda probe (12) is stable for the established 
steady-state operating condition. Furthermore, depending on whether the signal of the lambda probe (12) is stable or not, a lambda 
value for the at least one injection valve (10) is measured by means of the lambda probe (12) at the established steady-state operating 
condition.
