Abstract  =>  The invention relates to a support of plant origin, especially from macrophyte plants or other plants growing in a substrate or plants in an aqueous medium. Said support consists of a longitudinal segment of the leaf of a macrophyte plant that has been dried by a natural or artificial process, the result being the appearance of a macaroon, having an outer plant coating and an inner circular portion filled with a porous tissue. The type of plant used can be leaves of plants preferably such as typhas, neas, juncos, and cane for the structure and characteristics thereof. This support is used for the germination of seeds contributing to the growth and feeding of the seed until it becomes a plant, using the segment of macrophyte to which they adhere, said segment having particular characteristics as provider of oxygen and nutrition.
