other and are rotated in this state, resulting in the workpiece (W) being ground, and wherein between a dressing position (P2) where 
the threaded grinding stone (17) can be dressed and a retreat position (P1) to which a retreat is made from the dressing position (P2) 
during grinding, a disk dresser (66) which, by being driven into rotation, dresses the threaded grinding stone (17) is swung about an 
axis (C2) which is parallel to an axis (C1) that is the rotational axis for the workpiece (W) and which intersects, at right angles, the
