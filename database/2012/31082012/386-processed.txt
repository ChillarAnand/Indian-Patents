Abstract  =>  An antiseptic cleaning agent, generally, comprising chlorhexidine acetate and a solvent, such as an alcohol and/or water. The chlorhexidine acetate acts as a highly effective biocide. Additionally, the chlorhexidine acetate allows the cleaning agent to dry without leaving a tacky residue. Where the cleaning agent comprises one or more alcohols, the alcohols may comprise any suitable alcohols, including lower alcohols having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, such as ethanol and isopropanol. In addition to chlorhexidine acetate, the cleaning agent optionally comprises another non-alcohol biocide, such as triclosan. The cleaning agent can be used in any suitable manner. For instance, the cleaning agent may be impregnated in an absorbent material, such as a towelette, swabstick, or gauze. Additionally, the absorbent material may comprise a positively charged or a non-ionic substance, such as polypropylene or polyester. FIG 2
