Abstract  =>  Provided is a donepezil-containing transdermal absorption formulation that can sustainably administer donepezil for a long period of time, and can provide both a rapid increase in the blood level of donepezil and donepezil sustained release properties. The donepezil- containing transdermal absorption formulation is a transdermal absorption formulation produced by dissolving donepezil, which is the active ingredient, in an adhesive patch base that contains a hydrophobic polymer and an absorption promoter. The absorption promoter is one kind or two or more kinds selected from lauryl alcohol, triethyl citrate, isopropyl myristate, cetyl lactate, oleyl alcohol, sorbitan monooleate, polyethylene glycol monostearate, lauromacrogol, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, and triacetin.Disclosed is a transdermally absorbable donepezil-containing preparation which enables the administration of donepezil in a sustained manner for a long period and can achieve both the rapid increase in blood donepezil level and the sustained release of donepezil. The transdermally absorbable donepezil-containing preparation comprises an adhesive patch base material comprising a hydrophobic polymer and an absorption- enhancing agent and donepezil (an active ingredient) dissolved in the adhesive patch base material, wherein the absorption-enhancing agent comprises at least one component selected from lauryl alcohol, triethyl citrate, isopropyl myristate, cetyl lactate, oleyl alcohol, sorbitan monooleate, polyethylene glycol monostearate, lauromacrogol, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone and triacetin.
