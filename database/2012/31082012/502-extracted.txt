(57) Abstract : 
An electromagnetic lifter comprises at least two polar expansions (4), shaped for transporting a horizontal axis coil or the like, 
arranged perpendicularly to the axis of the coil to be lifted, divided into two halves (4a, 4b) slidable with respect to each other under 
the action of an actuator mechanism (5) and shaped so as to be able to penetrate each other. The adjustability of the polar expansions 
(4) allows them to better adapt to the different diameters of the coils to be lifted, with the result of exploiting the greatest possible 
useful polar section and of reducing to a minimum the operational air gaps, whereby the lifter need not be oversized to take into 
account the most unfavourable case and it results smaller, lighter and cheaper.
