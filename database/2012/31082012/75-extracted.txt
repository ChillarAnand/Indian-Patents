(57) Abstract : 
[Object] To provide an information processing apparatus, an information processing method, and a program capable of appropriately 
executing an application program in one program execution environment even in the case where a built-in library includes a plurality 
of libraries having the same library names. [Solving Means] A JVM pre-execution processing unit 6 obtains an application program 
name from an application information table AIT and stores the application program name in a RAM 404 with a DTV flag. The JVM 
pre-execution processing unit 6 obtains an application identifier from an AMT and stores the application identifier in the RAM 404 
with a BD flag. A JVM execution processing unit 12 sets a path for a BD when an attribute of a program selected by a user is the BD 
and sets a path for a DTV when the attribute is the DTV. The JVM execution processing unit 12 switches the path of the library file 
called in execution of a program in accordance with the attribute that indicates a distributer of the program selected by the user.
