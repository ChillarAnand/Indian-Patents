Abstract  =>  A labeling and preparation device for test tubes. At least one storage section places at least one pallet having a set of test tubes at a preset position. At least one transfer section is disposed above the storage section, and clamps or releases one of the test tubes. A labeling section is disposed below the transfer section, receives the test tubes transferred from the transfer section, and attaches a label having information related to a sample on a circumference of each test tube. An ejection section is disposed below the labeling section, and ejects the test tubes to an outside. A controller controls drivers of the transfer section, the labeling section and the ejection section.
