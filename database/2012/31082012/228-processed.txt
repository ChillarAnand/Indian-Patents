Abstract  =>  Methods provided may generally include sending a BS of a first RAT a request message indicating a set of MIMO resources to reallocate; during a scan duration, communicating with the BS of the first RAT using non-reallocated MIMO resources and communicating with a BS of a second RAT using reallocated MIMO resources; and during a normal duration, communicating with the BS of the first RAT using the reallocated and non-reallocated MIMO resources. Apparatus provided may generally include logic for receiving a request message indicating a set of MIMO resources of the MS to reallocate; logic for, during a scan duration, communicating with the MS in a first transmission mode assuming the use of only non-reallocated MIMO resources by the MS; and logic for, during a normal duration, communicating with the MS in a second transmission mode assuming the use of the reallocated and non-reallocated MIMO resources by the MS.
