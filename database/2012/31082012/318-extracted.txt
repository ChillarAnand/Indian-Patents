(57) Abstract : 
When the race begins the athletes are given the following instructions - On Your Marks-Get Set and a gunshot is fired. There is a split 
second reaction time to leave the blocks. This can seal the fate of the race. To give the athlete an advantage right at the beginning I 
have designed a starting block which can  Record the reaction time  Indicate a false start The starting block is a cylindrical bar(l) 
anchored to the ground using steel pegs(10) and has two handles(2,12) with rubber pads(4) on opposite sides to place the feet. The 
circuit will include one part which is placed away from this device and is fitted with an electronic counter (7) which will start when 
the button (9) on the sound source (8) (i.e. gunshot) is pressed. This is also attached with a cable to the starting block where the tiny 
Infra red sensors are placed in the middle of horizontal sides of the rubber pad(5,14) which are kept on after the athlete has taken the 
stance and break the circuit after that to stop the counter. An additional feature is a beep to indicate the foot left the block before the 
gun was fired and hence is a false start.
