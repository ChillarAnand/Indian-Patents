Abstract  =>  This disclosure provides novel ways to modify/functionalize, including crosslink, ligands in the surface coating or molecules in other coatings on a nanoparticle, by using radical addition reactions to add a reactant group onto a ligandimolecule of a nanoparticle. Examples include using a functionalized benzophenone that can be attached or crosslinked to a ligand in the surface coating of a nanocrystal by photochemically-initiated radical addition.
