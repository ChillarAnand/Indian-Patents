(57) Abstract : 
A method for making a modified release composition, comprising: selecting a desired active agent and polymer matrix for formulating 
into a modified release composition; assessing degradation effect on release of the active agent from the composition including 
plotting polymer molecular weight (Mwr) at onset of active agent release vs. active agent molecular weight (MwA); predicting 
performance of multiple potential formulations for the composition based on the degradation assessment and average polymer matrix 
initial molecular weight (Mwo) to define a library of building blocks; determining the optimal ratio of the building blocks to satisfy a 
specified release profile; and making a modified release composition based on the optimal ratio determination.
