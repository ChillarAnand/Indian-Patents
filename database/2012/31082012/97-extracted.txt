(57) Abstract : 
Method, corresponding apparatus and system are provided for transparently testing replacement functionality and optionally migrating 
subscribers on analog phone lines, served, for example, by PSTN Class 5 elements, to Next Generation Network (NGN) elements 
when copper co-termination is leveraged. According to an exemplary method, a telephone line for a telephone number is accessed 
through a metallic test access circuit of an analog network element and it is determined if the telephone line is available to test. If the 
telephone line is available to test, a port of a Next Generation Network element corresponding to the telephone number is activated, 
and it is determined whether a copper connection to the port of the Next Generation Network element is operating properly based on a 
voltage level received through the analog network element.
