Abstract  =>  A cellulose aerogel comprises a plurality of cellulose nanoparticles. The cellulose nanoparticles preferably comprise at least 50% or 80% cellulose nanocrystals by weight of cellulose nanoparticles, and the cellulose nanoparticle aerogel preferably has a density of from 0.001 to 0.2g/cm3 or from 0.2 to 1.59g/cm3 The cellulose nanoparticle aerogel typically has an average pore diameter of less than 100 nmm and the cellulose nanoparticles may comprise anionic and/or cationic surface groups.
