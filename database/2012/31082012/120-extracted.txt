An apparatus to indicate a position of a valve is described. An example position indicator apparatus includes a follower (302) 
operatively coupled to a flow control member (202) of a valve to sense a displacement of the flow control member. The example 
apparatus further includes a status indicator (304) to provide an indication that corresponds to the displacement of the flow control 
member to determine one of a plurality of predetermined operational positions of the valve and a visual display (328) to cooperate 
with the status indicator to indicate a position of the valve corresponding to one of the plurality of predetermined operational positions 
of the valve.
