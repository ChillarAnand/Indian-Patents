A security marker material comprising emissive particles and the emissive particles can be grouped into at least two groups with 
different size distributions and the size distributions satisfy the formula: [(x-z)2/(Sx2 + Sz2)J1/2>l wherein x and z are the volume-
weighted mean equivalent-spherical diameters of the two particle distributions and Sx and Sz are the standard deviations of the same 
two distributions.
