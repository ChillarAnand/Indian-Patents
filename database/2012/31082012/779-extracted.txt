(57) Abstract : 
A cellular basestation can select its own mobility parameters in order to achieve desirable effects in terms of the overall network 
performance. When a cellular basestation forms part of a group of such basestations on a single local area network, it can receive 
information from the other basestations in the group, for example relating to the loading on the other basestations, and can use this 
information in order to set mobility parameters. Where the basestation receives loading information from other basestations in the 
group, it can set mobility parameters so that a user equipment device becomes less likely to select a more highly loaded cell, and more 
likely to select a less highly loaded cell.
