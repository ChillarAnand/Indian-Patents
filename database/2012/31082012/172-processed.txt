Abstract  =>  Techniques for performing transmit power control based on receiver gain setting in a wireless communication network are described. In an aspect, a terminal A may estimate pathloss to another terminal B, e.g., based on a peer discovery signal received from terminal B. Terminal A may then determine a transmit power level for a peer-to-peer (PTP) signal (e.g., a paging signal) based on the estimated pathloss, a receiver gain setting at terminal B, and a target received power level for the PTP signal. Terminal A may send the PTP signal at. the determined transmit power level to terminal B. In another aspect, terminal B may use different receiver gain settings in different time intervals to receive PTP signals from other terminals. Terminal A may then select a suitable time interval to send the PTP signal based on the pathloss and the different receiver gain settings used by terminal B.
