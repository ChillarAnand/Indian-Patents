(57) Abstract : 
Some embodiments disclose systems and methods for a multiplexed multispectral imaging, object discrimination, background 
discrimination, and/or object identification. In some embodiments, a multispectral sensor is provided that includes at least two 
illumination sources and an imager with a color filter array. The two illumination sources can illuminate a platen with light having 
distinct illumination angles and distinct characteristics. The color filter array, which may be integral with the imager or separate 
therefrom, can filter light based on specific distinctions between the two illumination sources. A single image of an object at the platen 
can be acquired. Individual pixels of the image will then be highly associated with one or the other illumination source. Because of the 
filtering by the color filter array, this image will include information about the illumination angle. Some embodiments disclose a dual-
imager biometric sensor. The two imagers may include a direct imager and a TIR imager.
