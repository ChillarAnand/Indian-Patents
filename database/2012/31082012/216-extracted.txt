(57) Abstract : 
A preparation method and its use of derivatisation reagent for detecting L-carnitine or D-carnitine are provided. The present reagent is 
stable. It can be used for detecting L-carnitine or D-carnitine accurately and sensitively. That is to say, the reagent is applied to 
detecting the amount of synthesized or natural L-carnitine and the amount of mixing D-carnitine. The compound reagent is used for 
determining the chiral isomers of chemicals, biological reagents, health care reagents, cosmetic, body fluids and various foods, which 
contain L-carnitine or/and D-carnitine, and optical isomers of other chiral amino acids.
