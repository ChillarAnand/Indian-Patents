Abstract  =>  A regulator device for vehicle door glass, configured in such a manner that a lift arm and the entire device are reduced in thickness and that an equalizer arm can be easily formed by drawing. A lift arm (25) is provided with a through-hole (26), a flange wall (31), and a ridge (29) which is configured so as to form an annular gap (30) with respect to the flange wall and which protrudes a greater distance than the flange wall. An equalizer arm (40) comprises: a first arm (42) which is provided with a rotation shaft protrusion section (46) located on one surface side of the lift arm and rotatably engaging with the through-hole, and also with a rotation contact surface (47) in rotatable contact with the ridge; and a second arm (50) which is located on the other surface side of the lift arm and is provided with an affixation section (56) affixed to a rotation shaft section, and also with a contacting protrusion section (55) in rotatable contact with the other surface of the lift arm.
