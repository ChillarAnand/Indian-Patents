(57) Abstract : 
Provided is a machine displacement adjustment system for machine tools, which uses a tilt angle detector, such as a level, which can 
directly detect the tilt angle of a machine structure, such as a column. Said system is provided with: a tilt angle detector (a level) which 
is disposed on a machine tool structure, detects the tilt angle of said structure, and outputs data of the tilt amount; and an adjustment 
device (92) which has a tilt amount data inputting unit (93) for inputting the aforementioned data of the tilt amount (c1 to c6) obtained 
from the tilt angle detector, a machine displacement amount calculating unit (94) for calculating the machine displacement amount of 
the aforementioned structure on the basis of the data of the tilt amount (c1 to c6) inputted by means of the tilt amount data inputting 
unit, and an adjustment amount calculating unit (95) for calculating the adjustment amount of the displacement axes (X axis, Y axis, 
and Z axis) of the machine tool on the basis of the machine displacement amount of the structure calculated by means of the machine 
displacement amount calculating unit.
