(57) Abstract : 
Herein are reported glycosylated repeat-motif-molecule conjugate of the following formula: (repeat-motif-molecule - linkern)m - 
conjugation partner - (linkero - repeat-motif-molecule)p, wherein n and o are independently of each other and independently for each 
value of m and p integer values of 0 or 1, and m and p are independently of each other integer values of 0 or 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or 6 
or 7, and wherein the repeat-motif-molecule conjugate comprises at least one oligosaccharide attached to a glycosylation site. Also 
reported are encoding nucleic acids and method for producing these repeat-motif-conjugates in mammalian cells.
