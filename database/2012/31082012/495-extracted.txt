(57) Abstract : 
The present invention provides a process whereby pre-enrichment of water streams using a hydrogen source and a catalytic isotope 
exchange method at one or more remote sites to supply water with augmented deuterium concentration to a central heavy water. This 
central heavy water plant could utilize any suitable heavy water production technology, including the Combined Electrolysis and 
Catalytic Exchange (CECE) heavy water production plant and Girdler Sulfide process. The deuterium content of water at the remote 
sites is increased and provides water stream(s) with augmented deuterium concentration to feed to the central heavy water production 
plant. This could be a first stage of the central CECE deuterium enrichment plant, increasing its capacity for heavy water production 
approximately in the ratio of its enrichment above natural deuterium concentrations. The invention further provides systems and 
methods for adapting chlorate and chlorine dioxide systems which produce hydrogen to additionally produce deuterium-enriched 
water.
