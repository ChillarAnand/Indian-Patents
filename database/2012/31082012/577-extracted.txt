(57) Abstract : 
Disclosed are transplantation cells for an immunotherapy, which are applicable to a wider variety of patients compared to 
conventional transplantation cells for immunotherapies, and which can survive transiently so that severe GVH disease cannot be 
induced. Specifically disclosed is a pharmaceutical composition containing cells derived from human hematopoietic stem cells. In the 
pharmaceutical composition, the genetic locus of at least one human HLA class I molecule in the cells contains at least one antigen for 
which the type of matching of the cell is identical to that of a patient. The genetic locus of each of the human HLA class I and II 
molecules in the cells contains at least one antigen for which the type of matching of the cell is not identical to that of a patient, and 
the cells derived from the hematopoietic stem cells do not cause acute GVH disease having a severity of level III or IV in the body of 
a patient even when the cells survive in the patient permanently.
