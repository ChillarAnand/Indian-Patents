Abstract  =>  Provide are a method, a system and an apparatus for transmitting channel quality indicator information of multiple user terminals. The method includes: at least two user terminals transmit their own channel quality indicator information using the same time and frequency resources, wherein the time and frequency resources include at least one frequency-domain unit in frequency domain and at least two sets of data time-domain units in time domain, each set of data time-domain units including at least two data time-domain units; and the channel quality indicator information of each user terminal is transmitted on at least one set of data time-domain units by means of time-domain Code Division Multiple Address. Therefore, it is possible to adjust the transmitted bits according to size of the channel quality indicator information.
