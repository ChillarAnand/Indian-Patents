(57) Abstract : 
Methods and apparatus related to partitioning traffic segments are described. An access router, having concurrent connections with 
two access terminals, each desiring to transmit traffic signals to the access router in the same traffic segment, partitions a traffic 
segment. The partition is such that a first portion of the traffic segment is allocated to a first access terminal and a second portion of 
the traffic segment is allocated to the second access terminal. Control information, e.g., conveying partition information, is 
communicated to access terminals prior to the traffic segment. In some embodiments, the partition information is communicated as 
part of a transmission request response signal, e.g., via phase of the request response signal. An access terminal which has been 
allocated a traffic segment partition portion identifies is allocation from the transmitted control information, and subsequently 
transmits traffic signals to the access router in its allocated portion of the traffic segment.
