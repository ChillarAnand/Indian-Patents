Provided is a chamfering device such that in a simple configuration, position adjustments of a chamfering cutter and a deburring cutter 
with respect to a workpiece can be easily carried out. The chamfering device is equipped with the chamfering cutter (31); the 
deburring cutter (32), which has a diameter different from that of the chamfering cutter; and a cutter swing block (35), a cutter 
longitudinal feed block (42), and a base block (43), which rotatably support the chamfering cutter (31) and the deburring cutter (32), 
and are capable of subjecting the chamfering cutter (31) and the deburring cutter (32) to position adjustment with respect to the 
workpiece (W). The workpiece (W), the chamfering cutter (31), and the deburring cutter (32) are disposed so that the cutter 
longitudinal feed block (42) can perform single-axis feeding with respect to the workpiece (W). The chamfering cutter and the 
deburring cutter are disposed so that the cutting change amount of the chamfering cutter and that of the deburring cutter will be 
approximately equal to each other throughout the diameter range of the workpiece to be processed.
