(57) Abstract : 
An attachment structure of a clip and a mounting-subject member is provided which enables the clip to easily be attached to the 
mounting-subject member and which can prevent the dislodgement of the clip from the mounting-subject member in the attached 
state. This attachment structure is intended to attach a clip 10 including a flange portion 12 and locking legs 13 and a mounting-
subject member 30 together. The mounting-subject member 30 includes an insertion hole 35 having an insertion position 36 where the 
locking legs 13 is insertable and a fixing position 37 where the locking legs 13 is movable and the locking legs 13 are held at a certain 
location, fastening pieces 45 which are disposed above a front surface of the flange portion 12 so as to restrict the movement of the 
locking legs 13 in a dislodgement direction, and a unidirectional-movement-prevention unit which permits the insertion of the locking 
legs 13 from the insertion position 36 of the insertion hole 35 and restricts the moving back of the locking legs 13 towards the 
insertion position 36 when the locking legs 13 move to the fixing position 37.
