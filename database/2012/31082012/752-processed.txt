Abstract  =>  A 3-dimensional porous polymeric structure comprising a porous polymer structure optionally with particles within the pores of the polymer and wherein the pores have a narrow pore-size distribution. The structure may be made by closely packing particles in a zone to provide a 3-dimensional array, contacting a polymerisable monomer with the array such that the composition fills interstitial spaces between the particles and effecting polymerisation of the monomer whereby a polymer structure is formed around the particles and optionally removing the particles from the structure. The 3-dimensional porous structure may be used in solid phase synthesis, immobilisation, cell culturing and preparation of a stationary phase for chromatographic separation, as an absorbent, an insulating material or in tissue regeneration.
