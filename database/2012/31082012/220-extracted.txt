(57) Abstract : 
The invention relates to a method for producing a strand-like, particularly band-like semi-finished part for electrical contacts, wherein 
the semi-finished part has a top side intended for making the electrical contact, said top side made from a silver-based composite 
material in which one or multiple metal oxides or carbon are embedded, and has a carrier layer supporting the composite material 
made of easily solderable or weldable ignoble metal, said method having the following steps: - Powder-metaliurgic production of a 
block made from the silver-based composite material, - Encasing of the block made of the composite material with a powder made 
from the easily solderable or weldable ignoble metal, - Compressing the block, encased by the metal powder, to condense the metal 
powder, - Sintering the compressed block in a reducing atmosphere or in an inert atmosphere or in a vacuum, avoiding the formation 
of fluid eutectics from the silver of the composite material and from the non-precious metal with which the block made from the 
silver-based composite material is encased, - Reshaping of the sintered block by extrusion pressing, - Creating a partial strand with a 
top side made from composite material and a bottom side made from non-precious metal
