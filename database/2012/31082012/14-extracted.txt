(57) Abstract : 
A manufacturing method of a highly-reliable hermetic container having both joining strength and airtightness is provided. Sealants of 
which a viscosity has a negative temperature coefficient and of which softening point is lower than that of each of first and second 
glass substrates are formed in a frame shape having a discontinuous portion on the first glass substrate, and the second glass substrate 
is disposed to face the first glass substrate so as to press the sealants formed thereon by contacting them. Local heating light is 
irradiated to form the discontinuous portion at a boundary between a region irradiated by the local heating light and a region not 
irradiated by the local heating light, and a portion adjacent to the discontinuous portion is heated and melted to close the discontinuous 
portion, whereby a continuous sealed portion between the first and second glass substrates is formed.
