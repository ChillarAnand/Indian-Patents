Abstract  =>  The invention relates to a heat exchanger for generating steam for solar power plants, comprising: an outer casing with an inlet and an outlet port for a heat-emitting medium; an inlet and an outlet collector for a heat-absorbing medium, preferably water, said inlet and outlet collectors lying substantially within the outer casing; and a tube bundle within the outer casing with a number of tube layers comprising continuous tubes, which are designed such that the heat-emitting medium can flow entirely around same and which are designed as flow paths for the heat-absorbing medium from the inlet collector to the outlet collector. The tube bundle is designed in a meandering manner, wherein the heat exchanger for generating steam is designed according to the forced-flow principle so that the heat-absorbing medium, which is fed into the inlet collector, is successively pre-heated, evaporated, and superheated in the course of the flow paths so that a superheated steam exits the outlet collector. The energy required for the pre-heating, evaporation, and superheating is essentially provided entirely by the heat transfer from the heat-emitting medium to the heat-absorbing medium within the heat exchanger.
