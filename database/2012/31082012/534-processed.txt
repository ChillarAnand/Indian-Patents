Abstract  =>  A method and a corresponding tool for heating a metallic workpiece. In the method, the metallic piece is heated in a machine tool by attaching thereto an induction heating tool comprising a permanent magnet structure and by rotating and/or moving the metallic piece to be heated and the induction heating tool relative to each other at a suitable distance. In this case, heating eddy currents are induced in the piece, wherein the energy needed for heating is obtained from the motor of the machine tool.
