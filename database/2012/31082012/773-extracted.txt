shaft end sealing device and a concrete mixer provided with the same are provided. The shaft end sealing device comprises a wearable 
ring (31) connected to the mixing tank wall (30) of the concrete mixer, a dust cap (32) connected to a main shaft (21) of the concrete 
mixer and rotating with the main shaft synchronously, a first clearance (34) formed between the dust cap (32) and the wearable ring 
(31) and communicated with lubricating oil cavity, a sealing ring (33) arranged between the tank wall (30) and the main shaft (21), 
and a second clearance (35) formed between the sealing ring (33) and the main shaft (21) to constitute a labyrinth seal and 
communicated with the first clearance (34). The device can prevent slurry from directly seeping in an oil circuit and leaking out so as 
to increase the tightness and reliability of the device.
