(57) Abstract : 
Methods provided may generally include sending a BS of a first RAT a request message indicating a set of MIMO resources to 
reallocate; during a scan duration, communicating with the BS of the first RAT using non-reallocated MIMO resources and 
communicating with a BS of a second RAT using reallocated MIMO resources; and during a normal duration, communicating with 
the BS of the first RAT using the reallocated and non-reallocated MIMO resources. Apparatus provided may generally include logic 
for receiving a request message indicating a set of MIMO resources of the MS to reallocate; logic for, during a scan duration, 
communicating with the MS in a first transmission mode assuming the use of only non-reallocated MIMO resources by the MS; and 
logic for, during a normal duration, communicating with the MS in a second transmission mode assuming the use of the reallocated 
and non-reallocated MIMO resources by the MS.
