Abstract  =>  Provided are a recycling method for industrially, simply and effectively recycling a phenolic body from a phenolic antioxidant which is masked by an organoaluminum compound and contained in an olefin polymer obtained by supplying the masked phenolic antioxidant upon polymerization; and an olefin polymer obtained by this method. In a method for recycling a phenolic antioxidant wherein a phenolic antioxidant which is masked by an organoaluminum compound and contained in an olefin polymer obtained by supplying the masked phenolic antioxidant upon polymerization is recycled to a phenolic body, a nitrogen gas comprising water and/or a proton donor at a volume ratio of l.OxlO6 to 2.5xl0-2 with respect to 1 volume of nitrogen is brought into contact with the olefin polymer.
