Abstract  =>  Internal valve apparatus are described. An example internal valve includes a body (102) having a valve seat (202) disposed between an inlet (206) and an outlet (208). A flow control member (110) operatively coupled to the body moves between a first position in which the flow control member engages the valve seat to restrict the flow of fluid through the valve and a second position in which the flow control member is spaced from the valve seat to allow the flow of fluid through the valve. The example internal valve further includes a removable actuation member (114) disposed within the body and responsive to a fluid pressure to cause the flow control member to move between the first and second positions.
