The present subject matter relates to a method for adjusting a brake system of a vehicle. The method includes building up braking 
power automatically in an event of a collision, and terminating the automatic building up of the braking power by a defined driver 
reaction. According to the present subject matter, the terminating of the automatic building up of the braking power is carried out 
when the driver maintains an actuation of an accelerator pedal of the vehicle with a defined pressure for a minimum actuation period.
