wherein in Formula (1), each of Ra and Rb independently represents an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, and Ra and Rb may 
be bonded to each other to form a four- to six-membered ring: wherein in Formula (2), each of R1 and R2 independently represents -
CH2-, -NR6- or -O-; R1 and R2 are not both -CH2-; R6 represents an alkyl group having 1 to 3 carbon atoms, a hydroxyalkyl group 
having 1 to 3 carbon atoms, a hydroxyl group or a hydrogen atom; R3 represents a hydrocarbon group represented by -CraH2m-, -
CmH2m-2- or -CmH2m.4-; and m is an integer from 2 to 8: wherein in Formula (3), R4 represents -NR7- or -O-; R7 represents an 
alkyl group having 1 to 3 carbon atoms, a hydroxyalkyl group having 1 to 3 carbon atoms, a hydroxyl group or a hydrogen atom; R5 
represents a hydrocarbon group represented by -CnH2n-, -CnH2n-2- or -CnH2n-4-; and n is an integer from 2 to 8.
