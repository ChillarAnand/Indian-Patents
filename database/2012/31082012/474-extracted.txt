(57) Abstract : 
A steel plate structure and a steel plate concrete wall are disclosed. A steel plate structure, which includes: a pair 0f steel plates, which 
are separated to provide a predetermined space; a structural member, which is positioned in the predetermined space, and which is 
structurally rigidly joined to one si4e of the steel plate in the direction of gravity; and a strut, which maintains a separation distance 
between the pair of steel plates, caji be utilized to reduce the overall thickness of a steel plate concrete wall for efficient use of space, 
and to reduce the thickness of the steel plates for better welding properties and larger unit module sizes. Also, the axial forces or 
lateral forces applied on the steel plate concrete wall may be effectively resisted.
