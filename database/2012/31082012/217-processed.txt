Abstract  =>  The purpose of the invention is to provide an ethylene-a-olefin copolymer, which has a high melt tension but a small neck-in, and a molded object produced by extrusion molding of the copolymer. An ethylene-a-olefin copolymer having a monomer unit based on ethylene and a monomer unit based on an a-olefin having 3 to 20 carbon atoms, which has a melt flow rate (MFR) of 0.1 to 100 g/10 min, a density (d) of 850 to 940 kg/m3, a ratio (Mw/Mn) of weight average molecular weight (Mw) to number average molecular weight (Mn) of 2 of 12, and a valve g defined by the following formula (I) of 0.50 to 0.75: equation
