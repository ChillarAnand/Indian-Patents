(57) Abstract : 
A scleral incision template (SIT) and blade-knife is provided that facilitates adequate, efficient and smooth sclera-corneal tunnel 
dissection by achieving high quality scleral incision that may be close to ideal. The completed scleral incision has a correct 
predetermined size, shape, length, site and even depth throughout the length of the incisional groove. The synergetic action of the SIT 
with blade unit makes the sclero-corneal flaps uniform in thickness and tunnel uniform in depth. This facilitates the passage for the 
extraction of the cataract nucleus, as well as to implant the IOL inside the eyeball and also reduces complications more efficiently than 
when an incision is taken with help of blade-knife available.
