(57) Abstract : 
A system and method to capture contextual information in an image and compute feature descriptors for describing the captured 
contextual information have been disclosed. The system captures an image context effectively by combining information from across 
the region of interest in an image by inducing different types of motion. Generalized moment patterns are created by performing 
mathematical operations on this combined information and forms the basis for computing feature descriptors. These computed feature 
descriptors are generic and can be applied in varied computer vision and image processing applications including image classification, 
image matching, salient point detection, scene analysis or understanding, object detection, abnormality detection and the like.
