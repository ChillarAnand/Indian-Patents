Abstract  =>  Compacted additive blends, or polymer stabilization agent blends, can be added during the post-polymerization process to enhance the processability performance of polymers. The addition of certain compaction aids, such as high melting or non-melting metallic silicates and others, increases the resistance to friability of the compacted additive pellets. These compaction aids are non-migratory during the compaction process and after introduction into the polymer resin and thus have no deleterious effects. The additive blend can contain a variety of suitable additives in addition to the compaction aids.
