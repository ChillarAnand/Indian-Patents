Abstract  =>  A supercharging device for compressing charge air for an internal combustion engine having a scroll compressor is proposed, a displacement scroll (5) being connected to the supercharger shaft by way of an eccentric arrangement between a front bearing and rear bearing of the supercharger shaft (6), an externally driven drive element, such as a belt pulley or the like, being provided outside a housing (1) of the supercharging device, and the supercharger shaft (6) being connectable to the externally driven drive element by means of a controllable clutch member. The intended distinguishing features of the supercharging device according to the invention are a simpler bearing support and in particular a front bearing of smaller dimensions. This is achieved in that all connections of the drive and/or guide elements for the displacement scroll are arranged between the front bearing (2) and the rear bearing (3).
