Abstract  =>  Methods of preparing silicone materials using electron beam curing are described. The materials are hot melt processed and cured in the absence of an effective amount of catalysts and initiators. Both functional and nonfunctionalized silicone materials may be used. Exemplary cured materials include silicone pressure sensitive adhesives, silicone foams, and non-tacky silicone films.
