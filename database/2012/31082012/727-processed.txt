Abstract  =>  The present invention relates to insecticide and acaricide paints that inhibit chitin synthesis, regulate insect juvenile hormone and repel arthropods, for controlling endemic diseases, pests and allergens, characterized in that said paints comprise at least the following compounds (in any combination), namely: 1% - 100% water, 0.0001% - 20% insecticides, 0.0001% - 20% chitin inhibitor, 0.0001% - 20% juvenile hormone regulator, 1% - 50% polymers, 0% - 40% pigments, 0% - 60% fillers, 0% - 60% natural repellents, and 0.01% - 20% stabilizers. This is a novel, improved and enhanced formula for controlling all types of arthropods (insects, mites), both chemically, as the formulation incorporates synthetic insecticides, and biologically, owing to the incorporation of insect-growth regulators. Furthermore, an active ingredient is incorporated in the form of a natural arthropod repellent which keeps said anthropods at a distance from those places where the paint is applied. The composition of the paints allows the active ingredients to be encapsulated in an aqueous polymer with or without the incorporation of fillers and pigments, and therefore the range of use thereof is increased.
