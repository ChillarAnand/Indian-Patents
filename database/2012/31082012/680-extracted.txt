(57) Abstract : 
An apparatus lor monitoring EMG signals of a patients laryngeal muscles includes an endotracheal tube having an exterior surface. 
Conductive ink electrodes are fonned on the exterior surface of the endotracheal tube. The conductive ink electrodes are configured to 
receive the EMG signals from the laryngeal muscles when the endotracheal tube is placed in a trachea of the patient. At least one 
conductor is coupled to the conductive ink electrodes and is configured to carry die EMG signals received by the conductive ink 
electrodes to a processing apparatus.
