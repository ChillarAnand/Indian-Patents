(57) Abstract : 
An optical system is provided, for example for use with a display device (1), for varying the shape of a surface in which an image 
displayed by the display device (1) is perceived. The optical system comprises first and second spaced-apart partial reflectors (3, 5), at 
least one of which is switchable between a first non-flat shape and a second different shape, which may be flat or non- flat. The 
reflectors (3,5), together with polarisation optics (2,4), provide a light path (6) such that light from the display (1) is at least partially 
transmitted by the first reflector (3), partially reflected by the second reflector (5), partially reflected by the first reflector (3) and 
partially transmitted by the second reflector (5). Light which does not follow the light path (6) is prevented from leaving the optical 
system.
