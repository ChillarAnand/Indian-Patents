Abstract  =>  Method, corresponding apparatus and system are provided for transparently testing replacement functionality and optionally migrating subscribers on analog phone lines, served, for example, by PSTN Class 5 elements, to Next Generation Network (NGN) elements when copper co-termination is leveraged. According to an exemplary method, a telephone line for a telephone number is accessed through a metallic test access circuit of an analog network element and it is determined if the telephone line is available to test. If the telephone line is available to test, a port of a Next Generation Network element corresponding to the telephone number is activated, and it is determined whether a copper connection to the port of the Next Generation Network element is operating properly based on a voltage level received through the analog network element.
