Abstract  =>  In accordance with the present invention, an improved process for the preparation of crystalline choline fenofibrate using a single organic solvent, comprises steps of (a) hydrolyzing the choline chloride in an organic solvent at ambient temperature, leaving choline base free in the solution; (b) reacting the choline free base and fenofibric acid in presence of the same organic solvent at the same temperature to form a crystalline choline fenofibrate. The present invention also relates to a novel crystalline Form B of choline fenofibrate having characteristic XRPD diffraction peaks at 7.95, 15.90, 16.62, 17.35, 19.08, 19.33, 22.10, 22.63, 23.96, 28.42, 28.79 and 31.49 ± 0.2° 29.
