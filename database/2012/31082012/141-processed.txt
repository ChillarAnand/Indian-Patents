Abstract  =>  This method comprises connecting a downstream point (40) of a pipe (24) to a buoy (26) and completely submerging the buoy (26). It comprises deploying in the body of water (12) an intermediate section (30) of the pipe (24) from the downstream point (40) to at least as far as an upstream point (38), anchoring the upstream point (38), anchoring the upstream point (38), anchoring the upstream point (38), and tensioning the intermediate section (30) to keep it vertical. The height of the buoy (26) is less than 1.5 times its greatest transverse dimension. The method comprises moving the buoy (26) between a remote position and an installed position in line with an anchoring region, keeping the buoy (26) partly submerged on the surface (16) of the body of water.
