(57) Abstract : 
Embodiments of a method to optimize an access network are described. According to one embodiment, the method comprises 
computing an optimal outgoing configuration for all possible incoming configurations of each node in the access network. The 
plurality of nodes in the access network include at least one access node and one or more child nodes. A principal incoming 
configuration for one or more child nodes of the access network is determined based on the optimal outgoing configuration of the 
access node. A principal outgoing configuration corresponding to the principal incoming configuration is identified for the one or 
more child nodes. Further, based on the principal incoming configuration and the principal outgoing configuration of the nodes, an 
optimized configuration for the access network is obtained.
