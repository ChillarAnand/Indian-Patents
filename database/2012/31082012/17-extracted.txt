(57) Abstract : 
The present invention relates to a process of implementing, or engineering, topology-dependent functions based on a formal 
description of the Substation Automation system, by performing a topology analysis of the current single line state. A topology 
interpreting implementation replacing complex topology analysis logics requires only the project specific static single line topology 
and the connection to the real process state data. All this information can be delivered in an IEC 61850 conforming SCD file, which 
readily exists for any IEC 61850 based system. The engineering and testing effort of automatic load transfer functions for more 
complex single line topologies is thus reduced drastically. Also the interface description for controlling and monitoring the load 
transfer application can be generated automatically from the SCD file.
