(57) Abstract : 
A wear resistant steel material, produced in a powder metallurgical manner, has the following composition in weight-%: and, further, 
0.5 to 14 of (V + Nb/2), wherein the contents of N, on one hand, and of (V + Nb/2), on the other hand, are balanced in relation to each 
other so that the contents of said elements are within a range A, B, G, H, A in a perpendicular plane coordinate system, where the 
content of N is the abscissa and the content of V + Nb/2 is the ordinate, and where the coordinates for said points are: and max 7 of 
any of Ti, Zr, and Al; balance essentially only iron and unavoidable impurities. This steel is excellent for obtaining a wear resistant 
surface region on a substrate of a metallic material by hot isostatic pressing of the steel material of the substrate. Especially when the 
wear resistant steel is void of Co, the compound body obtained is especially suitable for use in e.g. valves for nuclear power plants.
