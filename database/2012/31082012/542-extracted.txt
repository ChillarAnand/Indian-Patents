(57) Abstract : 
An intraocular pressure sensor system has a first pressure sensor located in an anterior chamber of an eye and a remote pressure sensor 
located remotely from the first pressure sensor. The remote pressure sensor measures or approximates atmospheric pressure. A 
difference between readings from the first pressure sensor and the remote pressure sensor approximates intraocular pressure.
