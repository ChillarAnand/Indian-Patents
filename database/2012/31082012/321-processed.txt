Abstract  =>  The present invention relates to novel method for the detection of microbial contaminants in plant tissue cultures by the use of chemical indicators which work independent of pH and temperature conditions in plant tissue cultures. These chemical indicators work at various ranges of concentrations and are able to detect microbial contaminants at the earliest possible period of time once the plant tissue cultures are incubated for the plant growth.
