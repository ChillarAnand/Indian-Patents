Abstract  =>  A multilayer woven industrial fabric comprises at least two layers of weft yarns interwoven with at least one system of warp yarns. At least some of the machine side (MS) weft yarns are arranged as complementary pairs, such that for each pair, the members follow mutually complementary paths, and exchange positions with each other so that, in the MS surface, the path of a pair of weft yarns appears to be that of a single yarn. The complementary weft yarns interweave only with the MS warp yarns and do not appear in the paper side. The unique MS weft yarn arrangement allows for the use of smaller yarns, while increasing fabric stiffness and dimensional stability, and is applicable to any multi-layer fabric design which includes at least two layers of weft yarns and one system of warp yarns.
