(57) Abstract : 
A method of forming a corrosion resistant bushing includes bonding a sliding layer to a first surface of a load bearing substrate to 
form a laminate sheet and cutting a blank from the laminate sheet. The laminate sheet includes an exposed surface corresponding to a 
second surface of the load bearing substrate. The blank includes cut edges having a load bearing substrate portion. The method further 
includes forming a semi -finished bushing from the blank, and applying a corrosion resistant coating to the exposed surface and the 
load bearing substrate portion of the cut edges to form the corrosion resistant bushing.
