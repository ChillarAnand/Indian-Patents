Abstract  =>  The invention relates to a power supply having two inverters (A, B) in series for powering an electromechanical actuator having an electric motor including a plurality of windings (Rl, R2, R3) forming phases, each inverter being connected to its own ground (50; 51) and having a voltage source (Ul; U2) having as many arms (Al, A2, A3; Bl, B2, B3) connected thereacross as there are windings to be powered, each arm including two controlled switches (5, 6) connected in series, with a point therebetween being provided for connection to one end of one of the windings. According to the invention, each inverter includes an additional arm (A4; B4) having two controlled switches, the two additional arms being interconnected by a bridge (7) that is connected to each of the additional arms at a point that is situated between the switches.
