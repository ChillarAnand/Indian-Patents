(57) Abstract : 
The present invention provides a process for the preparation of a new polymeric composition which exhibits catalytic activity similar 
to hydrolytic enzymes especially -chymotrypsin. The process of the present invention involves reacting vinyl monomers comprising 
functional groups present in the active site of a-chymotrypsin. The functional groups are brought together by complexation with a 
metal ion and an appropriate print molecule. The complex is then immobilized by polymerization in the presence of a cross-linker and 
a U.V. sensitive monomer. The resulting composition exhibits hydrolytic activity similar to -chymotrypsin and is useful for the 
conversion of esters and amides to. the corresponding alcohols and amines. The composition offers additional advantages such as 
enhanced catalytic activity due to improved accessibility in the high surface area .polymeric catalyst, stability at elevated 
temperatures, ease of recovery from the reaction mixture, ability to withstand pH variations and ability to switch on-off the catalytic 
activity by photoregulation.
