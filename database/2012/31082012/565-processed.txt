Abstract  =>  The present invention relates to an improved draw-out mechanism for circuit breakers and/or switchboards. In the mechanism, plurality of plate means (8) securing said circuit breaker (3) on its both sides such that the circuit breaker (3) is movable on the plate means (8). A shaft means (14) is operatively engaged to the rail means (13). A bracket arrangement (4) is tightly engaged to the circuit breaker (3) and is fitted to the rail means (13) so as to move the circuit breaker (3) during draw-out operation. Plurality of link means (12) adapted to provide operative linkage between the rails (13) and the shaft means (14) such that rotational movement of the shaft means (14) provides corresponding linear movement of the rail means (13).
