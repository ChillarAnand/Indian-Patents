Abstract  =>  The embodiments of the present invention disclose a method for controlling video-audio data playing, which relates to the network communication field. The method includes: obtaining total duration of playing video-audio data in a buffer; calculating a time difference, the time difference being a difference between a current time point and a time point of receiving a latest video-audio data packet; and performing time domain stretch processing for video-audio data in the buffer when the total duration and the time difference satisfy a preset condition, and playing the processed video-audio data. The embodiments of the present invention also disclose an apparatus for controlling video-audio data playing. By using the method and apparatus, the incontinuity phenomena will be decreased when the video-audio data is played, so as to improve user experiences.
