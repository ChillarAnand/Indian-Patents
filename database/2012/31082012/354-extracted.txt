(57) Abstract : 
The invention  is used for mounting dental models to make it possible to reproduce the movement and relative position of the jaws of 
patient on whose jaws dentures or crowns are to be fitted, without the use of plaster / any other adhesive medium. In order to construct 
an acceptable denture or crown the dentist makes negative impression of the affected tooth / teeth. The negative impression of patients 
arches is then processed normally in a dental laboratory to become a mold into which material for forming positive dental casts is 
poured. These positive casts are duplicates of patients arches with or without teeth and will then become the primary model to which 
the denture or crown is to be constructed. The dental casts are then mounted mechanically in an articulator to permit arrangement of 
the dentures or crowns in their proper position for occlusion.
