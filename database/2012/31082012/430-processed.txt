An ice maker is container within the ice storage chamber to produce ice. A water storage tank is provided to supply water to the ice maker. The chiller contains a removable cage that holds cans or bottles of liquid refreshments. The chiller holds water and ice to bathe the cage in a low temperature slurry. A compressor, condenser and associated components are used to produce the low temperatures needed to produce the ice. In another embodiment, solid state thermoelectric modules take the place of the compressor, etc. The ice storage chamber and chiller are insulated with a high R rated insulation. Rotation is controlled by a control panel which can also monitor temperature, etc.
