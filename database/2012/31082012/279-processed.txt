Abstract  =>  In multicast transfer in a PON system, in order to reduce the possibility that an OLT 2 has failed in getting some report messages from terminal devices 6 because of lack of its processing capability and to reduce the waste of the band due to useless transmission of multicast packets, which is caused by a delay in reporting that a terminal device 6 has left a multicast group, by taking into consideration both the message processing capability of the OLT 2 and the number of ONUs each of which has terminal devices 6 being subordinate thereto and belonging to the same multicast group, the OLT 2 dynamically changes the longest response time included in a G-Query message or an S-Query message to control the timing at which a terminal device 6 transmits a report message.
