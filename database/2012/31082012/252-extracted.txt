(57) Abstract : 
The present invention relates to a method of manufacturing a rotor for a screening apparatus and a rotor structure for a screening 
apparatus. The rotor structure of the invention is particularly suitable in screening fibre suspensions of the pulp and paper industry. 
The apparatus according to the invention relates to a novel rotor construction, and especially to a novel means of fastening a 
turbulence element on the rotor surface. The rotor (10) of the present invention is provided with easily replaceable turbulence elements 
(30) so that at least a part of the rotor surface is provided with at least one area (12) having a surface configuration different from the 
remaining rotor surface (14), on which area (12) the turbulence element (30) is fastened.
