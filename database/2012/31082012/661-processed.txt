Abstract  =>  An aggregate detection device and a concrete mixing plant using the same are provided. The aggregate detection device comprises a bin level controller (3), a driving medium (5) and a detector (6). One end of the driving medium (5) is connected to the bin level controller (3), and the other end is connected to the detector (6). The aggregate detection device can automatically detect the level of aggregate in an aggregate storage bin (1), so as to exactly and reliably control a valve (8) of the aggregate storage bin (1).
