Abstract  =>  The invention relates to a process for the preparation of an aqueous hybrid polymer dispersion comprising an auto-oxidatively crosslinkable polymer and an addition polymer. The invention further relates to the aqueous hybrid polymer dispersion obtainable by said process, the use thereof for the manufacture of coating compositions, ink compositions or adhesives and to coating compositions comprising the hybrid polymer dispersion as a binder. The process comprises a first polymerization step wherein a first hybrid polymer dispersion is formed by addition polymerization of vinyl monomers in the presence of dispersed auto-oxidatively crosslinkable polymer and a second polymerization step wherein secondary polymerization loci are provided in the first hybrid polymer dispersion to polymerise residual vinyl monomer of the first polymerisation step. The aqueous hybrid polymer dispersions have very low residual vinyl monomer content by achieving a high if not full conversion of the vinyl monomers at the end of the polymerization.
