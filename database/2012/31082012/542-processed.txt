Abstract  =>  An intraocular pressure sensor system has a first pressure sensor located in an anterior chamber of an eye and a remote pressure sensor located remotely from the first pressure sensor. The remote pressure sensor measures or approximates atmospheric pressure. A difference between readings from the first pressure sensor and the remote pressure sensor approximates intraocular pressure.
