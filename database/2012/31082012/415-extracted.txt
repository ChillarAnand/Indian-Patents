(57) Abstract : 
A coupler (10) for coupling an attachment to an excavator having a latching member (30) for retaining a rear pin (26) of the 
attachment and a blocking member (40) for retaining the front pin of the attachment. A hydraulic actuator (32) and spring (90) are 
provided for holding the latching and blocking members (30, 40) in their closed states. In the event of a failure of the actuator, the 
spring (90), the latching member (30) and the blocking member (40) together hold the front and rear pins (26, 26) in their respective 
recesses (20, 22) to allow continued operation of the coupler (10), while allowing the pins to move with respect to the coupler to 
create a rattling movement that can indicate to the operator that a failure has occurred.
