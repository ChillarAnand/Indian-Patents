(57) Abstract : 
The invention relates to a process for controlled atmosphere brazing comprising, brazing an aluminium alloy without flux in a 
controlled atmosphere, while using brazing sheet comprising of an aluminium alloy core upon which on at least one side a layer of 
filler alloy is clad, the filler clad layer having an inner-surface and an outer- surface, the inner-surface is facing the core and the outer-
surface is devoid of any further metallic based layers, and wherein the filler alloy has a composition which is Na-free, Li-free, K-free, 
and Ca-free, and comprising, in wt.%: Si 3% to 15%, Mg 0.05% to 0.5%, one or more elements selected from the group consisting of: 
(Bi 0.03% to 0.2%, Pb 0.03% to 0.2%, Sb 0.03% to 0.2%, and the sum of these elements being 0.2% or less), Fe 0 to 0.6%, Mn 0 to 
1.5%, the balance aluminium and incidental impurities.
