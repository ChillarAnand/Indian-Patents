Abstract  =>  There is disclosed a position sensing device comprising: i) a cylindrical core (12) having a longitudinal axis; ii) at least three discs or flanges (16 - 19) mounted about the longitudinal axis of the core; and iii) conductive wire coil windings (13 - 15) around the longitudinal axis between each adjacent pair of discs or flanges, to define at least a first coil (14) between a first pair (17, 18) of discs or flanges and a second coil (15) between a second pair (18, 19) of discs or flanges. The conductive wire of each coil winding comprises a conductive metal with a substantially dielectric oxide or ceramic coating, and the discs or flanges are made of non- polymeric material. By avoiding the use of polymeric components, the device can be used at very high temperatures without requiring a separate cooling arrangement.
