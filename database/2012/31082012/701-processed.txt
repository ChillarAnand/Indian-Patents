Abstract  =>  To provide an installation for producing a coal cake suitable for coking which can in principle have any desired formats, but in particular also very large formats adapted to large-format coking oven chambers, it is proposed according to the invention, for the vibratory compaction of granular raw coal materials, to arrange at least one vibrating station (10 or 16) with a push-table vibrating machine with an oscillatorily mounted vibrating table on which a mould box to be filled with a batch of the raw coal material can be clamped, the successively vibration-compacted cuboidal coal blocks being stackable and a transporting device introducing the coal cake that can be put together from a multiplicity of coal blocks into an empty coking oven chamber for the purpose of coking and coke production.
