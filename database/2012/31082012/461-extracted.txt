(57) Abstract : 
The vertical movement cycle and the movement trajectory inclination angle of a cutter (114) are switched so that when a main spindle 
(113) is moving downward, a head (112) is moved so as to position the cutter (114) at a machining location, and the cutter (114) is 
lowered rectilinearly; that when the main spindle (113) is moving upward, the head (112) is moved so as to position the cutter (114) at 
a withdrawal location; that, furthermore, when an external gear is to be generated by cutting, relieving means (117, 118, 120,121) for 
rectilinearly raising the cutter (114) cause the machining location to be positioned on one radial side of the cutter (114) and move the 
cutter (114) downward parallel to the axis of a workpiece (1A); and that, meanwhile, when an internal gear is to be generated by 
cutting, said relieving means (117, 118, 120,121) cause the machining location to be positioned on the other radial side of the cutter 
(114) and move the cutter (114) downward parallel to the axis of the workpiece (1A).
