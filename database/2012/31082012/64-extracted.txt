(57) Abstract : 
Techniques for transmitting and receiving data in a relay communication network are described. Stations in the relay network may be 
grouped into multiple depths. Packets may be transmitted in a pipelined manner, with stations at progressively higher depth sending 
transmissions of a packet in successive frames. In an aspect, a station may receive data with interference cancellation. The station may 
obtain a received signal containing transmissions of a first packet from stations at a first depth and transmissions of a second packet 
from stations at a second depth. The first and second stations may be downstream and upstream stations, respectively, or may be 
upstream stations at different depths. The station may estimate and cancel interference due to the transmissions of the first packet from 
the received signal to obtain an interference canceled signal. The station may then process the interference canceled signal for the 
second packet.
