Abstract  =>  The present invention has an object to provide a graphic chair having a fine graphic, wherein the chair is made of a transparent material, the graphic can be clearly seen from any side of the material, and the graphic is not damaged by mechanical contact from both sides; and to provide a graphic chair with a personalized design producible cheaply even if the system of producing various kinds of products in small lots is employed. The foregoing objects could be achieved by a method for manufacturing a graphic chair, whose at least any one of a seat part and a backrest part or both consist(s) of a substrate having a configuration of both sides of the graphic sandwiched by transparent resin A and transparent resin B, wherein the substrate is obtained by carrying out Step (1) in which a film having the printed graphic is inserted into a mold at the time of injection molding of transparent resin A and then the graphic printed on the film is transcribed to surface of transparent resin A in the mold, simultaneously with injection molding of transparent resin A, and thereafter carrying out Step (2) in which a mold half to which side the film having the printed graphic is inserted is moved backward to form a space between the mold and the graphic on transparent resin A and then transparent resin B is injection molded in the space.
