(57) Abstract : 
The present invention provides a photovoltaic (PV) cell structure for enabling the conversion of incident light to potential electrical 
energy. The PV cell comprises at least one energy guiding means for converting incident light to potential electrical energy. The 
energy guiding means includes at least one electron donor and at least one electron acceptor adapted to be linked to a load 
therebetween. The electron donor is operable to release electrons based on absorption of photons and the electron acceptor may be 
operable to accelerate photons towards the electron donor and attract electrons released by the electron donor. The electron donor may 
include at least one photon receptor adapted to have a surface disposed at an angle normal to a range of incident photon angles.
