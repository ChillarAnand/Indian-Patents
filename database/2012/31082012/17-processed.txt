Abstract  =>  The present invention relates to a process of implementing, or engineering, topology-dependent functions based on a formal description of the Substation Automation system, by performing a topology analysis of the current single line state. A topology interpreting implementation replacing complex topology analysis logics requires only the project specific static single line topology and the connection to the real process state data. All this information can be delivered in an IEC 61850 conforming SCD file, which readily exists for any IEC 61850 based system. The engineering and testing effort of automatic load transfer functions for more complex single line topologies is thus reduced drastically. Also the interface description for controlling and monitoring the load transfer application can be generated automatically from the SCD file.
