(57) Abstract : 
An object is to switch executions of applications appropriately from one to another when a plurality of applications use a limited 
resource. A mobile device (1) is provided with an execution state shift unit (61) for shifting an execution state between a multiplex-
execution state and a single-execution state in a multi-application execution environment, a resource release unit (62) for releasing a 
resource used by applications being executed in the multi-application execution environment, an application stop unit (63) for 
stopping an application other than the application to be executed in the single-execution state, and a resource allocation unit (64) for 
allocating the resource released by the resource release unit (62) to the application to be executed in the single-execution state when 
the execution state is shifted from the multiplex-execution state to the single-execution state by the execution state shift unit (61).
