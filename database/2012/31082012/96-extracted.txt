(57) Abstract : 
Techniques presented herein disclose handover using increased probability of the fast ranging success. Propagation delay of the RF 
signal transmitted from an MS to a target BS may be estimated based on a known propagation delay to a current serving BS and a 
relative difference in propagation delays to the current serving BS and the target BS, for example, as indicated by different receive 
times of preamble sequences transmitted from the current serving BS and the target BS.
