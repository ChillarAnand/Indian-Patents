(57) Abstract : 
The invention relates to a method with which uranium from a natural uranium concentrate may be purified. This method comprises: a) 
extracting the uranium present as uranyl nitrate in an aqueous phase Al resulting from the dissolution of the natural uranium 
concentrate in nitric acid, by means of an organic phase which contains an extractant in an organic diluent; b) washing the organic 
phase obtained at the end of step a), with an aqueous phase A2; and c) stripping the uranyl nitrate of the organic phase obtained at the 
end of step b) , by circulating this organic phase in an apparatus, as a counter current against an aqueous phase A3; and is 
characterized in that the extractant is an N, N-dialkylamide and in that the ratio between the flow rate at which the organic phase 
obtained at the end of step b) and the aqueous phase A3 circulate in the apparatus where step c) occurs, is greater than 1. 
Applications: refining of natural uranium concentrates produced by uranium mines.
