(57) Abstract : 
The instant invention provides an isocyanate trimerisation catalyst system, a precursor formulation, a process for trimerising isocyanates, rigid foams made therefrom, 
and a process for making such foams. The trimerisation catalyst system comprises: (a) a substituted iminium cation; and (b) an isocyanate-trimer inducing anion; 
wherein said trimerisation catalyst system has a trimerisation activation temperature in the range of equal to or less than 73 0C. The precursor formulation comprises (1) 
at least 25 percent by weight of polyol, based on the weight of the precursor formulation; (2) less than 15 percent by weight of a trimerisation catalyst system, based on 
the weight of the precursor formulation, comprising; (a) a substituted iminium cation; and (c) an isocyanate-trimer inducing anion; wherein said trimerisation catalyst 
system has a trimerisation activation temperature in the range of equal to or less than 73 0C; and (4) optionally one or more surfactants, one or more flame retardants, 
water, one or more antioxidants, one or more auxiliary blowing agents, one or more urethane catalysts, one or more auxiliary trimerisation catalysts, or combinations 
thereof. The process for trimerisation of isocyanates comprises the steps of: (1) providing one or more monomers selected from the group consisting of an isocyanate, a 
diisocyanate, a triisocyanate, oligomeric isocyanate, a salt of any thereof, and a mixture of any thereof; (2) providing a trimerisation catalyst system comprising; (a) an 
substituted iminium cation; and (b) an isocyanate-trimer inducing anion; (c) wherein said trimerisation catalyst system has a trimerisation activation temperature in the 
range of equal to or less than 73 0C; (3) trimerising said one or more monomers in the presence of said trimerisation catalyst; (4) thereby forming an isocyanurate ring. 
The process for making the PIR foam comprises the steps of: (1) providing one or more monomers selected from the group consisting of an isocyanate, a diisocyanate, a 
triisocyanate, oligomeric isocyanate, a salt of any thereof, and a mixture of any thereof; (2) providing polyol; (3) providing a trimerisation catalyst system comprising; 
(a) a substituted iminium cation; and (b) an isocyanate-trimer inducing anion; wherein said trimerisation catalyst system has a trimerisation activation temperature in the 
range of equal to or less than 73 0C; and (4) optionally providing one or more surfactants, one or more flame retardants, water, one or more antioxidants, one or more 
auxiliary blowing agents, one or more urethane catalysts, one or more auxiliary trimerisation catalysts, or combinations thereof; (5) contacting said one or more 
monomers, and said polyol, and optionally said one or more surfactants, and optionally said one or more flame retardants, and optionally said water, and optionally said 
one or more antioxidants, and optionally said one or more auxiliary blowing agents in the presence of said trimerisation catalyst system and optionally said one or more 
urethane catalysts, and optionally said one or more auxiliary trimerisation catalysts; (6) thereby forming said polyisocyanurate/polyurethane rigid foam. The PIR foam 
comprises the reaction product of one or more monomers selected from the group consisting of an isocyanate, a diisocyanate, a triisocyanate, oligomeric isocyanate, a 
salt of any thereof, and a mixture of any thereof with polyol in the presence of a trimerisation catalyst system comprising a substituted iminium cation, and an 
isocyanate-trimer inducing anion, and optionally one or more surfactants, optionally one or more flame retardants, optionally water, optionally one or more 
antioxidants, optionally one or more auxiliary blowing agents, optionally one or more additional urethane catalysts, and optionally one or more auxiliary trimerisation 
catalysts, or optionally combinations thereof, wherein the trimerisation catalyst system has a trimerisation activation temperature in the range of equal to or less than 73 
0C. The PIR foam comprises the reaction product of one or more monomers selected from the group consisting of an isocyanate, a diisocyanate, a triisocyanate, 
oligomeric isocyanate, a salt of any thereof, and a mixture of any thereof with polyol in the presence of a trimerisation catalyst system comprising a substituted iminium 
cation, and an isocyanate-trimer inducing anion, and optionally one or more surfactants, optionally one or more flame retardants, optionally water, optionally one or 
more antioxidants, optionally one or more auxiliary blowing agents, optionally one or more additional polyurethane catalysts, and optionally one or more auxiliary 
trimerisation catalysts, or optionally combinations thereof, wherein the PIR foam has a polyisocyanurate trimer ratio (Abs1410/Abs1595) of at least 5 at a depth of 12 
mm from the rising surface of the rigid foam, measured via ATR-FTIR spectroscopy.
