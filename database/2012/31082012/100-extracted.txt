(57) Abstract : 
The invention relates to active interference suppression in a satellite communication system, particularly but not exclusively to an 
apparatus and method for using active interference suppression in order to suppress co-channel interference between user signals in 
the communication system. The communication system includes a receive or transmit antenna having a plurality of antenna elements, 
each antenna element associated with a respective antenna element signal. The method includes the steps of calculating complex 
weighting values for one or more of a plurality of beam signals, adjusting the beam signals in accordance with the calculated complex 
weighting values and cancelling co-channel interference in at least one of the beam signals using the one or more adjusted derived 
beam signals to provide an interference suppressed output signal. The complex weighting values can be calculated based on a constant 
modulus algorithm.
