(57) Abstract : 
In the disclosed method, an engine valve (V) filled with metallic sodium (Na) within is produced by means of hardening metallic 
sodium (Na)that has been liquefied through heat-meltinginto rods by linearly discharging the metallic sodium (Na) in a liquid 
hydrocarbon (120), thus cooling the metallic sodium, then inserting these rods into a hollow section (H) through the opening (M) of a 
stem section (S), and then sealing the opening (M).
