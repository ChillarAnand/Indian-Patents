(57) Abstract : 
Provided are an electrolytic cathode structure that can suppress the degradation of an activated cathode even if a reverse current flows 
upon the stoppage of operation of an electrolyzer in an electrode structure allowing the distance between the electrode and an 
electrode current collector to be maintained at an approximately constant value, and an electrolyzer using the same. The electrolytic 
cathode structure includes a metal elastic cushion member 1 compressed and accommodated between an activated cathode 2 and a 
cathode current collector 3. At least a surface layer of the cathode current collector 3 consumes a larger oxidation current per unit area 
than the activated cathode. The electrolyzer is partitioned by an ion exchange membrane into an anode chamber for accommodating an 
anode and a cathode chamber for accommodating a cathode. The electrolytic cathode structure is used for the cathode.
