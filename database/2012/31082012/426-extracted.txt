(57) Abstract : 
A medical device, system, and method are described for treating in utero a fetus with a lower urinary tract obstruction. An implantable 
medical device may have a flexible catheter and an anchor. The catheter may define a proximal port, a distal port, a longitudinal axis, 
and a lumen providing fluid communication between the ports. The anchor may be affixed to the catheter at a position between the 
ports, and may have a resilient proximal member and a resilient distal member spaced a longitudinal distance apart, the proximal 
member and distal member each extending radially outward with respect to the longitudinal axis. An elongate delivery member may 
be releasably affixed to the medical device, and the medical device may be delivered through a tubular sheath defining a sheath lumen.
