Abstract  =>  The invention provides a way of producing a natural immunologically active state in a person by subjecting him to an apheresis procedure with bioincompatible biomaterials for about one hour. To safely control the immunological shock induced by this procedure, the person is put under general anesthesia for about six hours, including the apheresis time and at least an additional five hours thereafter. This immunological activation is useful for treating malignant tumors and diseases related to immunosuppression, such as AIDS. The invention also provides for the use of an apheresis column containing a blood perfusion filter with bioincompatible materials for treating malignant tumors and infectious diseases.
