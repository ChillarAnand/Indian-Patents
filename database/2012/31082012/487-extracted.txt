(57) Abstract : 
This invention relates to a permanent dye for colouring keratinous fibres, in particular one based on the extract of Terminalia chebula, 
also known as Black Myrobalan or Chebulic Myrobalan, a 30 metres tall evergreen tree native to southern Asia from India/Nepal to 
southwestern China to Sri Lanka, Malaysia and Vietnam bearing 2 to 4.5 cm long dark drupe-like fruit with longitudinal ridges. Non-
permanent hair colour comprises either active species which are larger than 10 Angstroms and can only coat the hair shaft rather than 
diffuse through the pores into the hair shaft or active species which are not larger than 10 Angstroms and can diffuse through the pores 
into the hair shaft but once within the hair shaft are able to react or associate with either another species to form a product larger than 
10 Angstroms or the internal surface of the hair shaft and thereby to become trapped within the hair shaft. This invention therefore 
provides a permanent dye for colouring keratinous fibres, the permanent dye comprising: (d) A solution of iron (II) or iron (III) salt; 
(e) A solution of an aqueous extract of Terminalia chebula; and (f) A solution of at least one colour developer selected from the group 
consisting of a polyphenol, the breakdown products of a polyphenol, derivatives thereof and mixtures of polyphenols; wherein the iron 
(II) or iron (III) salt and the at least one colour developer selected from the group consisting of a polyphenol, the breakdown products 
of a polyphenol and derivatives thereof react to form a complex, and wherein the polyphenol, the breakdown products of a 
polyphenol, derivatives thereof and mixtures of polyphenols is not in the form of an aqueous extract of terminalia chebula. A method 
of colouring keratinous fibres using the permanent dye is also provided.
