(57) Abstract : 
The invention relates to a moldable wire thread insert (1) for reinforcing a screw opening of a component comprising the following 
characteristics: a cylindrical spiral (20) formed by a helically wound wire (10), wherein neighboring windings (30) of said spiral are 
arranged such that a closed cylindrical spiral wall (22, 24) is present, while at least one end of the cylindrical spiral (20) comprises a 
fastening flange (40) that extends radially outward over the cylindrical spiral wall (22, 24) and by which the wire thread insert (1) can 
be anchored in the component, and/or an end of the cylindrical spiral (20) is designed planar to form a flat axial end face of the 
cylindrical spiral (20).
