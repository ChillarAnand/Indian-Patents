Abstract  =>  A system for adjusting temperature of flue gas at the outlet of a waste heat recovery boiler of a pre-heater in a cement kiln is described herein. The system includes a conditioning tower, a waste heat boiler, and at least one low pressure steam boiler provided at the outlet of the waste heat boiler. The conditioning tower conditions the flue gas coming from a pre-heater of the cement kiln, the waste heat boiler condenses flue gases coming from the pre-heater, thereby producing steam, and the low pressure steam boiler adjusts the pressure of the flue gas coming out of the waste heat boiler.
