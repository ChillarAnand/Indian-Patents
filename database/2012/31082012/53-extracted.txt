(57) Abstract : 
This disclosure provides novel ways to modify/functionalize, including crosslink, ligands in the surface coating or molecules in other 
coatings on a nanoparticle, by using radical addition reactions to add a reactant group onto a ligandimolecule of a nanoparticle. 
Examples include using a functionalized benzophenone that can be attached or crosslinked to a ligand in the surface coating of a 
nanocrystal by photochemically-initiated radical addition.
