(57) Abstract : 
 The present disclosure provides for a method and a system to generate security threat report in the area of Industrial Automation. This 
includes configuring a scheduler 107 for selected or all Human Interface Stations 102 in a plant data network. Further, the security 
threat data is collected from the Human Interface Station(s) 102 of the network based on predetermined constrains assigned by the 
scheduler 107. Once the data is collected, it is stored into a storage unit 106 to obtain key performance index (KPI) by performing 
index calculation on the stored data. These KPIs are later used to generate security threat reports.
