(57) Abstract : 
Techniques for determining a discontinuous reception (DRX) cycle used to receive paging are described. A user equipment (UE) may 
have (i) a first DRX cycle used by a first network (e.g., a core network) to page the UE and (ii) a second DRX cycle used by a second 
network (e.g., a RAN) to page the UE. In an aspect, the UE may use the longer DRX cycle and ignore the shorter DRX cycle, when 
allowed, to extend battery life. In one design, the UE may receive an indication of whether the second DRX cycle can be ignored or is 
to be considered by the UE. The UE may use the longer DRX cycle if the second DRX cycle can be ignored and may receive paging 
from the first network and/or the second network based on the longer DRX cycle. In another aspect, the UE may negotiate a DRX 
cycle with a network.
