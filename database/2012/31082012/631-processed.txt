Abstract  =>  An echo canceller (1399) with adaptive non-linearity is disclosed. In an embodiment, an incoming signal (1301 ) coming in from the far end is passed to a probe signal adder, which may add a probe signal to the incoming signal and may perform other signal conditioning before passing the signal to a playback device (1304). A recording device (1310) picks up a part of the signal generated by the playback device and also picks up other sounds/physical phenomena from its environment. An echo remover creates an estimate of the signal picked up by the recording device from its environment alone without the signal generated by the playback device. The echo remover creates this estimate by using the signal going towards the playback device and the signal recorded by the recording device. A linear filter estimator (1342) generates an estimate of the linear filter section of the environment, which may be used by the echo remover.
