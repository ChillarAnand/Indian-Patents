(57) Abstract : 
The present invention provides a process for producing low color glycols that comprises altering at least one condition of a reaction 
component and/or process stream within the process to be unfavorable for the formation of at least one color-producing contaminant 
intermediate. As such, such intermediates may be reduced in concentration, or even eliminated entirely, from glycols produced by the 
process. Since they are not present, or are present in reduced number, the intermediates cannot form color-producing contaminants in 
the glycols, and low color glycols are provided to the customer.
