Abstract  =>  A woven fiber preform (100, 200), a fiber reinforced composite incorporating the preform (100, 200), and methods of making thereof are disclosed. The woven preform (100, 200) includes a plurality of warp and weft yarns or fibers interwoven to form a continuous spiral fabric (50). The spiral fabric (50) may take the shape of an Archimedes spiral. The weft yarns in the preform (100, 200) may have a uniform or variable pick spacing, or a uniform or variable angular separation. The spiral fabric (50) of the Archimedes spiral may be assembled or wrapped to form a conical shell structure, which could be a portion of a spinner or an exit cone. The spiral fabric (50) may be woven on a loom equipped with a differential take-up mechanism.
