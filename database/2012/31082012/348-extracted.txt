A diaphragm operated CNG pressure regulator (100) connected to a CNG cylinder, comprising: a bonnet (114), a diaphragm (115), a 
body (116), a junction block (117), a safety relief valve (113), a high-pressure filter (112), a bull-nose connector (120), a CNG 
pressure gauge (111)and a refueling adaptor (104), said regulator (100) is rigidly minted on the CNG cylinder directly at said junction 
block (117) by means of a bull-nose connector (120) and a coupling screw (119) in a sealing manner, therein the outlet pressure of 
CNG can be reduced from 200 to any desired pressure by adjusting the spring load exerted by a spring (100) on said diaphragm (115) 
by means of an adjusting screw(109).
