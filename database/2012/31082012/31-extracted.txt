(57) Abstract : 
Method for determining the state of charge of a battery in charging or discharging phase The method for determining the state of 
charge of a battery comprises measurement of an electric parameter of the battery during a charging or discharging phase of the 
battery followed by placing the battery in open circuit during a rest period (t0-t3). During the rest period (t0-t3), at least two values of 
the voltage at the battery terminals are measured. An indicator is then calculated according to the electric parameter and to values of 
the voltage measured during the rest period, and the state of charge corresponding to this indicator is then determined by means of a 
calibration curve representative of the variations of the indicator as a function of the state of charge of the battery.
