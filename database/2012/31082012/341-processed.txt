Abstract  =>  A method for continuous production of an alcohol to produce ethanol from molasses, including a fermentation step of continuously fermenting a mixed liquid containing molasses and ethanol fermentation yeast having flocculating and settling properties in a fermentor to obtain a fermentation liquor; a yeast separation step of continuously withdrawing the fermentation liquor from the fermentor and sending the fermentation liquor to a yeast separation tank, and separating yeast cells of the ethanol fermentation yeast by gravity settling from the fermentation liquor in the yeast separation tank to obtain a de-yeasted fermentation liquor and a yeast cell suspension; a yeast cell return step of continuously withdrawing the yeast cell suspension from the yeast separation tank and returning the yeast cell suspension to the fermentor; and a suspended solids separation step of continuously withdrawing the de-yeasted fermentation liquor from the yeast separation tank, sending the de-yeasted fermentation liquor to a suspended solids separation tank, and separating suspended solids derived from molasses by gravity settling from the de-yeasted fermentation liquor in the suspended solids separation tank to obtain a suspended solids-separated fermentation liquor and a suspension of suspended solids.
