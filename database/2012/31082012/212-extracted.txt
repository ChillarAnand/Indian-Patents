(57) Abstract : 
The present invention relates to a progressive multilevel interactively guided method and device for inputting to an apparatus any 
object among a set of up to NN objects having each a symbolic representation, the small device comprising N sensible and N visual 
zones in correspondence one by one and having same form and relative positions, the method comprising the steps of showing N 
objects in each visual zone, a first actuation of the sensible zone associated with the visual zone showing the object to be selected, the 
distribution of the N shown objects in each N visual zones, a second actuation of the sensible zone associated with the visual zone 
showing the object to be selected, and an inputting of the selected object to the apparatus when the sensible zone is released. The 
objects symbolic representations are positioned within the visual zones in such a manner that the method is intuitive, easy to memorize 
and flexible, and via progressive levels, upward compatible with faster, chordic and less or no visual area demanding methods. The 
invention also relates to network systems using programs executing such methods and devices.
