Abstract  =>  An apparatus for manufacturing a glass perform, includes: a dummy tube section, a reservoir portion, and a cooling portion; and a glass tube section in which particles of an alkali metal compound or an alkaline earth metal compound which have flowed into the glass tube section from the dummy tube section are heated by a second heat source which performs traverse, and oxides of the particles being deposited on an inner wall and dispersed in the glass tube section. In the cooling portion of the dummy tube section, vapor of the alkali metal compound or the alkaline earth metal compound generated by heating of a first heat source is cooled and condensed by a dry gas flowing into the dummy tube section, and thereby the particles are generated.
