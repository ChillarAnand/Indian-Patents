(57) Abstract : 
Methods and systems are provided for supporting co-existence of two radio access technologies (RATs), which include determining 
the frame structure of a first RAT, including the boundary of subframes, the DL:UL subframe ratio, and switching periodicity, 
selecting a frame offset and a DL:UL subframe ratio in a second RAT to minimize the number of punctured symbols in the second 
RAT, and transmitting frames in the second RAT with the selected frame offset and subframe ratio.
