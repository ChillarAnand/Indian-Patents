(57) Abstract : 
The invention relates to an ultrasonic transducer (110) for use in a fluid medium. The ultrasonic transducer (110) comprises at least 
one piezoelectric transducer element (138) and at least one adapting body (140) for facilitating oscillation injection between the 
piezoelectric transducer element (138) and the fluid medium. The ultrasonic transducer (110) also comprises a housing (112), wherein 
the piezoelectric transducer element (138) is inserted into the housing (112). The housing (112) has at least one opening (122) which 
faces the fluid medium, wherein the adapting body (140) is at least partially inserted into the opening (122). The ultrasonic transducer 
(110) also has at least one sealing element (146) which seals at least one intermediate space (158) between the adapting body (140) 
and the housing (112) in such a manner that an internal space (128) of the housing (112) is at least largely sealed with respect to the 
fluid medium.
