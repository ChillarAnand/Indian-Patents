(57) Abstract : 
Rectal suppositories are used to administer a predetermined drug dosage to treat a variety of diseases and symptoms in a variety of 
patient populations. Certain medical conditions, such as digestive disorders, may be more effectively treated when the suppository is 
placed in a particular location of the patients anal canal or rectum. A method and apparatus for inserting a suppository into an animal 
or human may include an applicator having a barrel and plunger. The barrel maintains a first gas flow path during insertion of a 
suppository and the plunger maintains a second gas flow path during withdrawal of the plunger. By maintaining a first and second gas 
flow path, trapped air and suction effects on the suppository are minimized or eliminated. Furthermore, patients may immediately 
resume day-today activities. These benefits may encourage patients to maintain a course of treatment thereby potentially avoiding 
additional complications, hospitalization, and costs.
