(57) Abstract : 
The present disclosure relates to adenovirus protein modifications to augment immune response to a transgene of a recombinant 
adenovirus and to circumvent pre-existing anti-adenovirus immunity. Some embodiments are directed to a recombinant adenovirus 
derived from a recombinant adenovirus plasmid vector, wherein the recombinant adenovirus plasmid vector comprises a nucleotide 
sequence encoding a Plasmodium circumsporozoite protein, or antigenic portion thereof, operably linked to a heterologous promoter 
and a modified capsid or core protein, wherein an immunogenic epitope of Plasmodium circumsporozoite is inserted into or replaces 
at least part of a capsid or core protein. Other embodiments are directed to a pharmaceutical composition or a malaria vaccine 
composition comprising a recombinant adenovirus according to the above embodiments. Further embodiments include a method of 
treating, preventing, or diagnosing malaria, comprising administering a therapeutic amount of the pharmaceutical composition or 
malaria vaccine composition in accordance with the above embodiment.
