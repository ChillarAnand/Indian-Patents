Abstract  =>  Provided is a treatment system whereby a wet organic waste can be effectively treated and CO2 produced in the course of the treatment can be stabilized to thereby contribute to the reduction of CO2 emission. The treatment system is characterized by comprising microbiologically fermenting a wet organic waste in a fermenter, combusting in a furnace a fermented material obtained from the fermenter and, at the same time, supplying to the furnace a fermentation gas produced by the microbiological fermentation in the fermenter, and then recovering and stabilizing CO2 in a hot exhaust gas evolved during the combustion in the furnace.
