(57) Abstract : 
Certain embodiments of the present disclosure provide a method for switching radio frequency (RF) carriers that serve communication 
between a base station (BS) and a mobile station (MS). The switching of carriers can be viewed as a handoff procedure between two 
different RF carriers within the same BS. A simplified handoff procedure for switching of RF carriers can be applied when the MS 
switches its physical connection from a primary RF carrier to a secondary RF carrier, as well as in the case when the BS decides to 
move the MS from one primary RF carrier to another primary RF carrier.
