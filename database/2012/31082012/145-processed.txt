Abstract  =>  A circuit (22) for measuring the effective current (ieff(t)) of a signal to be monitored (i(t)) characterized in that it comprises means for slaving a DC reference signal (iDC(t)) to the signal to be monitored (i(t)) in such a way that the effective current (iDCeff(t)) of the DC reference signal (iDC(t) } is equal to the effective current (ieff(t)) of the signal to be monitored (i(t)).
