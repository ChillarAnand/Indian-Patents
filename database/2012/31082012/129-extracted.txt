(57) Abstract : 
An implant for insertion into a disc space between vertebrae, wherein the implant includes a spacer portion, a plate portion coupled to 
the spacer portion, two bone fixation elements or engaging the vertebrae and a retention mechanism for preventing the bone fixation 
elements from postoperatively backing-out of the plate portion. The retention mechanism may be in the form of a spring biased 
snapper element that is biased into communication with the bone fixation elements so that once the bone fixation element advances 
past the snapper element, the snapper element is biased back to its initial position in which the snapper element interfaces with the 
bone fixation elements. Alternatively, the retention mechanism may be in the form of a propeller rotatable between a first position in 
which the bone fixation elements are insertable to a second position where the bone fixation elements are prevented from backing-out.
