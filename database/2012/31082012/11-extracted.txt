recording medium; and a recording controller, in the case of a determination that the basic and extended streams are interleaved with 
respect to each data in the predetermined unit and recorded, designating a first file among the first file that manages the basic stream 
and allowing copying of the basic stream to a second recording medium, and designating a second file that manages the extended 
stream and allowing copying of the extended stream to the second recording medium.
