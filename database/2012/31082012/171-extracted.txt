(57) Abstract : 
Field removable bonnet assemblies for use with valves are described herein. An example field removable bonnet assembly for use 
with internal valves includes a body (208) that is to be removably coupled to the internal valve. The body defines a bore that is to 
receive a valve packing (220). Additionally, the field removable bonnet assembly includes a shaft (210) having a cam assembly (212) 
that is to rotatably engage a stem of the internal valve. The shaft is rotatably coupled to the body and the shaft is at least partially 
positioned within the bore. Further, the field removable bonnet assembly includes a removable adjuster (222) that is externally 
accessible to enable an adjustment of the removable adjuster relative to the body to change a force exerted by the valve packing on the 
shaft. The removable adjuster is field removable to replace or repair the valve packing.
