Abstract  =>  The present invention relates to binding proteins specific for VEGF-A, in particular to recombinant binding proteins comprising a binding domain, which inhibits VEGF-Axxx binding to VEGFR-2. Examples of such binding proteins are proteins which comprise an ankyrin repeat domain with the desired binding specificity. The binding proteins are useful in the treatment of cancer and other pathological conditions, e.g. eye diseases such as age-related macular degeneration.
