(57) Abstract : 
A radio base station apparatus wherein even when a single-base-station transmission and a plural-base-station cooperative 
transmission are implemented at the same time, the terminal-to-base-station feedback information amount and the ICI can be reduced, 
thereby improving the reception characteristic of a terminal existing in the vicinity of a cell edge. A base station (100) uses a first 
transmission mode, in which only the base station implements a signal transmission, and a second transmission mode, in which the 
base station implements a cooperative signal transmission together with another radio base station apparatus, to communicate with one 
or more radio terminal apparatuses. A setting unit (103) sets, as a particular frequency band the reception quality of which is to be 
measured, one of first and second frequency bands that are parts of a band used for communications with the terminals. A deciding 
unit (101) decides, as the transmission mode for the terminals, one of the first and second transmissions on the basis of the reception 
quality of the particular frequency band.
