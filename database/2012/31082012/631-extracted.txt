(57) Abstract : 
An echo canceller (1399) with adaptive non-linearity is disclosed. In an embodiment, an incoming signal (1301 ) coming in from the 
far end is passed to a probe signal adder, which may add a probe signal to the incoming signal and may perform other signal 
conditioning before passing the signal to a playback device (1304). A recording device (1310) picks up a part of the signal generated 
by the playback device and also picks up other sounds/physical phenomena from its environment. An echo remover creates an 
estimate of the signal picked up by the recording device from its environment alone without the signal generated by the playback 
device. The echo remover creates this estimate by using the signal going towards the playback device and the signal recorded by the 
recording device. A linear filter estimator (1342) generates an estimate of the linear filter section of the environment, which may be 
used by the echo remover.
