Abstract  =>  A surface modifying composition comprises an amphiphilic compound which is non-cellulose based, the amphiphilic compound including a covalently linked ionic moiety with the following formula: where M= metal oxide or binary metal oxide, Ai is selected from compounds with surface energy greater than or equal to 25 dynes cm-1, A2 is selected from compounds with surface energy greater than or equal to 12 dynes cm-1, A3 is selected from compounds having more than one reactive functional group, x = NH2, NHR or NR2 (R= methyl, ethyl, propyl or isopropyl), y= COOH, SO3H or PO3H, and R= H or halogen; and where one of the A1 -x, A2, or A3-y may be replaced by a second O-R.
