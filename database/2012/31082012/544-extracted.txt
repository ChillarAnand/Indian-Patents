lowering of implement hitched to three point linkage of the tractor to an adjustable height, wherein the operator can pre-set the lifting 
height of the implement to any desired value, just enough to clear the ground. The synergistic hydraulic and electronic combination 
and configuration of the this quick-lift sub-assembly, valve block, cylinder assembled with the rockshaft and the control lever working 
in tandem with each other enables the operator to set and select extent of rotation of the rockshaft enabling quick implement lifting / 
lowering by desired extent just enough to clear ground in the field resulting in productivity / utilization enhancement of the off-road
