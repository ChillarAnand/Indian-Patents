Abstract  =>  Stabilized liquid agrochemical compositions are provided which comprise flowable non-aqueous dispersion concentrates comprising a continuous substantially water-miscible liquid phase, a dispersed water-immiscible liquid phase, and a colloidal solid. In one embodiment, the dispersed phase comprises at least one water-sensitive agrochemically active ingredient and the colloidal solid is disposed at the interface between the dispersed phase and the continuous phase. In another embodiment, the water-sensitive agrochemically active ingredient is a solid but is dissolved in an oily liquid present in the dispersed phase, or is a solid and is dispersed within the dispersed phase, or is a solid complex of an agrochemical with a molecular complexing agent and is dispersed within the dispersed phase. The compositions of the invention can be used directly or with dilution to combat pests or as plant growth regulators.
