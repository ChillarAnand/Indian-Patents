(57) Abstract : 
An object of the present invention is to provide a disposable wearing article having improved bulkiness as well as flexibility of the 
outer sheet by using crimped fiber as a material for the outer sheet and bonds the inner and outer sheets by adhesive to provide the 
article with a good texture and a good appearance. A first waist region 13 as a whole or in its part lying in a vicinity of a waist-opening 
is elasticized and formed of an inner sheet 32 defining the skin-facing side and an outer sheet 30 defining the non-skin-facing side 
wherein the non-skin-facing side of the outer sheet 30 is formed substantially over its entire area with a plurality of 
thermocompression-bonded spots 20 regularly and intermittently arranged at predetermined intervals. The outer sheet 30 has non-
thermocompressed regions 64 surrounded by a plurality of thermocompression-bonded spots 20. A fibrous layer lying at least on the 
outer surface of said outer sheet 30 is formed of thermal adhesive crimped fibers 63 which are bonded together by 
thermocompression-bonding treatment in the thermocompression-bonded spots 20. The outer sheet 30 and the inner sheet 32 are 
bonded to each other by adhesive 35 applied on at least one of respective opposite surfaces thereof so that the crimped fibers 63 in the 
non-thermocompressed regions 64 may protrude outward in a thickness direction of the outer sheet 30 as the inner sheet 32 contracts 
in the direction of the transverse axis Q.
