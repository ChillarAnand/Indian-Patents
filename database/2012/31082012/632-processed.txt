Abstract  =>  The present invention aims to provide a wearing article adapted to prevent unintentional displacement of a crotch region relative to front and rear waist regions by elastics attached to the crotch region. A diaper 10 includes front and rear waist members 20, 30, a crotch member 40 by the intermediary of which the front and rear waist members 20, 30 are connected with each other. The rear waist member 30 is formed with a waist fit section 30a and an appendix section 30b. Of the crotch member 40, front and rear ends including front and rear end flaps 45, 46 are bonded to the front and rear waist members 20, 30, respectively, to form front and rear bonded regions 61, 62. Both side flaps 49 are provided on respective inner surfaces thereof with gasket elastics 71 attached thereto. Each of the gasket elastic 71 overlaps at one end 71a with a part of the front waist elastic 26 and overlaps at the other end 71b with a part of the appendix section elastic 51. Furthermore, the one end 71a overlaps with the front bonded region 61 and the other end 71b overlaps with the rear bonded regions 62.
