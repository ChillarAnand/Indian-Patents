A front face sheet for an absorbent article having multiple welding-compressed parts, characterized in that the welding-compressed parts are located on the lowermost face in the thickness direction of the front face sheet and, on the back side of the front face sheet, the welding-compressed parts are surrounded by valleys or low-density sections having the lowest density within the front face sheets. The front face sheet for an absorbent article having these welding-compressed parts can be produced by locating a front face sheet between a member having multiple peaks and another member having multiple valleys capable of engaging with the preceding multiple peaks and then pressing the peaks into the valleys.
