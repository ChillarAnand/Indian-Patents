Abstract  =>  A data communication involves selecting a group (15) of M multiple source nodes (12, 16) among N multiple source nodes (10, 12, 14, 16) present in a communication system (1) and having data destined for a destination node (30), where 2 â‰¤ M < N , A relay node (20) network codes data from the selected group (15) of M nodes (12, 16) to form combined, network coded data. This resulting data is sent to towards the destination node (30). The purposeful selection of source nodes (10, 12, 14, 16) in connection with network coding substantially increases the throughput of the communication system (1).
