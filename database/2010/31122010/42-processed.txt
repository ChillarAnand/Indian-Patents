Abstract  =>  According to one embodiment, there is provided a multistage-pressure condenser, including a first condenser, a second condenser and a third condenser, which are arranged in increasing order of internal pressure, the first condenser and the second condenser each including a first partition in which perforations from which condensate obtained by condensing turbine steam by cooling water drops are formed on a cooling water inflow side of the condenser rather than at a central part thereof, and a second partition which partitions a reheating room for reheating condensate dropping from the perforations in a direction perpendicular to an inflow direction of the cooling water, and a heating-steam flow path which supplies heated steam from the third condenser to the reheating room partitioned by the first partition and the second partition.
