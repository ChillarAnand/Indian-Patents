(57) Abstract : 
The present invention provides a simple and cost effective method for synthesis of diarylpyrimidine non-nucleoside reverse 
transcriptase inhibitor such as etravirine. Typically, etravirine is synthesized by using 2,4,6-trichloropyrimidine and 3,5-dimethyl-4-
hydroxybenzonitrile. Further, there are disclosed simple processes for condensation of 4-aminobenzonitrile with a compound of 
formula (V) i.e. 4--[(2,6-dichloro)-4-pyrimidinyloxy]-3,5-dimethylbenzonitrile.
