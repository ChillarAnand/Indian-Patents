(57) Abstract : 
The present invention describes a lipid nanovesicle encapsulating a pharmaceutical formulation of paclitaxel. The lipid nanovesicle is 
a combination of two phospholipids viz DPPC and DOPE. The nanovesicles achieve a stealth character without the addition of any 
polymers. The nanovesicles show an increased efficacy in drug resistant cancers by bypassing p glycoprotein efflux. The drug release 
from the nanovesicle is both temperature and pH triggered. The said formulation is administered both as an aerosol and an intravenous 
formulation and offers a high therapeutic efficacy.
