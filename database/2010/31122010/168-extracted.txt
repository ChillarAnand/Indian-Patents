(57) Abstract : 
Arrangement in a hose connector of a riser (2) provided between a wellhead and a floating surface installation (1). One or more hoses 
(3) form a flexible fluid communicating connection between an upper portion of the riser (2) and the floating surface installation (1). 
The first end portion (211) of at least one fluid conduit (21) is fixed to the riser (2) by an upwardly directed, first pipe muzzle (212) 
and is provided with a rotatable connecting sleeve (213a, 213b, 213c). Each of one or more flexible hoses (3) is connected to a conduit 
spool (41) of a connecting assembly (4) provided with a second pipe muzzle (42) that is arranged for releasable mating with the first 
end portion (211) of the fluid conduit (21). A lifting yoke (43) is connected to the connecting assembly (4) and forms an actuator (431) 
which is able to effect rotary motion to the connecting sleeve (213a, 213b, 213c) to enable engagement.
