Abstract  =>  An adjustable, dual speaker element ear- phone is described. One of the speaker elements (the smaller one) is sized to fit into the cavum concha of the listener’s ear and the other element (the larger one) is not. The positioning of the speaker elements may be adjustable so that the user can adjust the positioning of the speaker elements for increased comfort. A hinged joint may allow the larger speaker element may be rotated about a vertical axis of the hinged joint so that the larger speaker element can be rotated towards or away from the listener’s ear. The smaller speaker element may be adjusted relative to the larger speaker element by a joint that provides multiple degrees of rotational freedom for the smaller speaker element relative to the larger speaker element.
