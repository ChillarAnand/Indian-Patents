Abstract  =>  This document describes tools capable of enabling cloud-based movable-component binding. The tools, in some embodiments, bind protected media content to a movable component in a mobile computing device in a cryptographically secure manner without requiring the movable component to perform a complex cryptographic function. By so doing the mobile computing device may request access to content and receive permission to use the content quickly and in a cryptographically robust way.
