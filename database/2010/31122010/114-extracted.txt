(57) Abstract : 
The composition of the invention is based on zirconium oxide, which comprises 1 to 20% yttrium oxide, 1 to 30% tungsten oxide and 
the balance zirconium oxide. This composition may have a specific surface area of at least 40 m2/g after calcination at 700Â°C for 4 
hours and an acidity measured by the methylbutynol test of at least 90%. The composition may be used as a catalyst or catalyst 
support, especially for the treatment of motor vehicle exhaust gases.
