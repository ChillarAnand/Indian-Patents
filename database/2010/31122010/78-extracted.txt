(57) Abstract : 
An optical fiber having reduced Polarization Mode Dispersion is provided. The optical fiber comprises spin imparted in the optical 
fiber along the length of the optical fiber about the axis of the optical fiber. The spin is imparted alternatively in clockwise and 
anticlockwise direction, wherein maximum number of spins imparted in the optical fiber in successive clockwise direction and 
anticlockwise direction are not equal, whereby, at least the spins imparted in the optical fiber in successive clockwise direction and 
anticlockwise direction are asymmetric.
