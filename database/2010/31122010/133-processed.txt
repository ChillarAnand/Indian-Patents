Abstract  =>  A urinary catheter with an improved retaining and activating feature is provided which is a safe device with reduced irritation and discomfort to a patient. The retaining mechanism positioned at the proximal end of the catheter assumes a close state for introduction and removal of the catheter into and from the urethral tract, and is transitioned into the open state when the catheter is in the bladder by mechanically manipulating the retaining mechanism through the activation mechanism. An actuating linkage wire connected between the retaining mechanism and activation mechanism controllably reciprocates in the channel of the catheter to transition the catheter between the open and closed states.
