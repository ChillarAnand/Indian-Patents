(57) Abstract : 
A secure keypad system has a touch sensitive screen (11) with a plurality of distinct fields (12) on a surface, where each field (12) has 
an associated input value. A plurality of force sensors (16, 17) are coupled to the screen (11) and arranged at individual force sensor 
locations to sense individual forces in response to the screen (11) being touched and to generate corresponding individual force 
signals. Identification means are provided for identifying a field (12) being touched based on the force signals, and generating means 
are provided for generating the input value associated with the field (12) being touched. An electrically conductive, force transmissive 
casing (20) encloses the force sensors, the identification means and the generating means.
