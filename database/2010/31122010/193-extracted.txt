(57) Abstract : 
The invention relates to a granulated personal care shampoo comprising a shampoo composition comprising at least one surfactant 
agglomerated with a water-soluble, water- dispersible or water-insoluble solid particulate carrier. Preferably, the shampoo 
composition additionally contains a conditioner preferably comprising an organopolysiloxane. The granulated shampoo of the 
invention can dissolve readily with formation of shampoo foam in hot or cold water, and can be perceived as soft in the dry state, free 
flowing state and providing a pleasant feel on the skin. The granulated shampoo can be packaged in various types of biodegradable 
packaging such as paper (environmentally more friendly than plastic sachets) to form a stable package which do not deteriorate on 
storage.
