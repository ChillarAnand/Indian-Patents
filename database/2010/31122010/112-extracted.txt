(57) Abstract : 
The invention relates to a method of securely transferring data, in which method the source data stored in a source memory 
(NV_MEM) is compared with the transferred data (COPY_ELT_X_V_MEM) that has been copied from the source memory 
(NV_MEM) into a destination memory (V_MEM). The method consists in reading from the source memory (NV_MEM) an integrity 
value (PI_ELT_X) associated with an element (ELEMENT_X_NV_MEM) such as file containing the source data, in calculating the 
integrity of a reconstituted element made up of the transferred data (COPY_ELT_X_V_MEM) associated, where appropriate, with the 
data of the source element (ELEMENT_X_NV_MEM) other than the data that was transferred, and in deciding that the transferred 
data (COPY_ELT_X_V_MEM) is identical to the source data when the integrity calculation gives a value identical to the integrity 
value of the source element (PI_ELT_X). The method applies to transferring data between components of a smart card.
