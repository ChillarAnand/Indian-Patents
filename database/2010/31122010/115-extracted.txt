(57) Abstract : 
The present invention extends to methods, systems, and computer program products for block count based procedure layout and 
splitting. Embodiments of the invention utilize code block counts to provide a total ordering of code blocks that improves execution 
time of generated procedure code by minimizing branches along more frequently executed paths. The total ordering is optimized using 
prioritized precedence relationships. For example, the total ordering is optimized to maximize the appropriate placement of code block 
chains after other code block chains. The total ordering is also optimized to place zero count (untouched) code blocks after any non-
zero (touched) code blocks. FIG. 1
