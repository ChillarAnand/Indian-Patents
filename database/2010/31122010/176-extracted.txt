(57) Abstract : 
A biobased resilient tile includes at least one base layer (2), at least one film layer (3), and a topcoat (4). The base layer (2) includes a 
polymeric binder and a filler. The base layer (2) has at least about 20 - 95% weight of the filler and at least about 5% weight of 
recycled material. The film layer (3) is supported by the base layer (2). The film layer (3) is a rigid film selected from the group 
consisting of polyethyleneterephthalate, glycolated polyethyleneterephthalate, polybutylene terephthalate, polypropylene terephthalte, 
or a thermoplastic ionomer resin. The film layer includes recycled material. The topcoat (4) is provided on the film layer (3). The 
topcoat (4) is a radiation curable biobased coating comprising a biobased component selected from the group consisting of a biobased 
resin, a biobased polyol acrylate, or a biobased polyol.
