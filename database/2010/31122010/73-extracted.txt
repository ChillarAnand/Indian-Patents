(57) Abstract : 
A distributed phase shifter capable of changing the phase of a high-frequency signal in a wider band than ever before. The distributed 
phase shifter comprises an output-side strip conductor which has a shape of a circular arc which is a part of a circular ring and has its 
both ends serving for output ends, an input-side strip conductor with its one end positioned at the center of the circular ring, a sliding 
portion which has a shape of a circular arc which is a part of the circular ring and is shorter than the output-side strip conductor, and 
an arm portion which has a sliding portion at the end and can be turned around the center of the circular ring. An insulating material is 
interposed between the output-side strip conductor and the circular-arc sliding portion and between the input-side strip conductor and 
the arm portion. A ring-shaped conductor of the input-side strip conductor and a ring-shaped conductor of the arm portion face each 
other via the insulating material. The arm portion consists of a first and a second line each of which has its one end connected to the 
sliding portion and the other end electrically connected to the ring-shaped conductor of the arm portion.
