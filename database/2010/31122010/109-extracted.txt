(57) Abstract : 
The invention relates to a wind power system control deviec and an operating method thr wind power systems having a wind rotor 
(12) and a generator (13) driven by the wind rotor (12), comprising a torque control unit (5) for a torque of the generator (13). 
According to the invention, an auxiliary controller comprises a detector (71) tor detecting a. grid failure and the end thereof; a residual 
moment indicator (72) providing a default value for a torque of the generator (13) afier detecting the grid failure, and an initializer 
initializing a component of the torque control unit (5) to the deihult value after detecting the grid failure. According to the invention, 
the vibration behavior of the wind power system upon return of grid power can be significantly improved by initializing the torqne 
control unit (5) at the end of the grid failure to a predetermined torque value. Overload of the drivetrain upon return of grid voltage 
can he reduced to 1/4 in a simple manner.
