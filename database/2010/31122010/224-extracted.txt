(57) Abstract : 
Methods of generating and expanding human hemangio-colony forming cells and non- engrafting hemangio cells in vitro and methods 
of expanding and using such cells are disclosed. The methods permit the production of large numbers of hemangio-colony forming 
cells, non-engrafting hemangio cells as well as derivative cells, such as hematopoietic and endothelial cells. The cells obtained by the 
methods disclosed may be used for a variety of research, clinical, and therapeutic applications. Human non-engrafting hemangio cells 
are a novel progenitor cell population that is related to but distinct from the hemangioblast and human hemangio-colony forming cells. 
The invention also provides compositions, preparations, and solutions comprising hemangio-colony forming cells, non- engrafting 
hemangio cells or cells differentiated therefrom. The compositions, preparations, and solutions include cryopreserved preparations and 
substantially purified preparations, as well as mixed compositions formulated in combination with related hemangioblast progenitor 
cell types that can engraft into the bone marrow.
