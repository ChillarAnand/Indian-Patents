Abstract  =>  The running Train, way longer in its path, pulls up a Gear Driving Chain(2), which is above or beside the trains body using a Chain- Connector(1), where the same Gear Driving Chain(2) is connected to two other gears 3a and 3b one at the origin and the other at the destination of the rod-posters(4) beside the railway track. A Gear Driving Chain(2) is connected with a Chain Driven Gear (3), Which is mounted over the Main Shaft(5) of the Rod Poster(4). In order to pull the Gear Driving Chain(2) all through its path, a connector is set over the front end of the Trains body to get connected or to get hooked up to the same chain using a hook or a small shaft in the circular- hole which the chains usually comprise. The said chain is a Gear Driving Chain(2), where this drives a gear which is followed by a Gear Box and Generator in turn. The Chain Driven Gear, comprises some supporting Gears in order to sustain the connectivity of the chain with the Gear from slipping.
