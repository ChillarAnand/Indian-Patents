(57) Abstract : 
This invention provides the combined driving spring in the slide cover hinge of mobile communication terminal. It comprises multiple 
springs in the same shape, the multiple springs are arranged and combined in turn on the same plane, with their both ends fixed; the 
driving spring is provided with connections on its both ends to match with the slide in the slide hinge. The shape of spring is similar to 
shape W. The driving spring provided by this invention can be directly used as a driving mechanism in slide hinge for mobile 
communication terminals, simplifying the structure of driving mechanism. In particular, when the spring in the shape of W is 
employed, the spring can not only facilitate the combination connection, but also provide a greater force. Besides, when the slide 
cover slides,less area is occupied when spring deforms,making it easier to arrange other parts of mobiles device.
