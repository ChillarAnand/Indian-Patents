identification of products parts or other vital statistics and this marking must be able to withstand the ups and downs of the 
manufacturing or handling process and are also vision readable. For these many industries are using this Permanent Etch Marking or 
Electrolytic Etch marking. Permanent etch marking process is used for printing an impression or stamping trade marks on the 
conductive surface, with the help of a stencil and an electrolyte. The electrolytic marking procedure is based on the electrochemical 
process. Depending on the source of material and the current flow mode, the results are black or white with a shallow or deep etch 
markings without any negative effects on the material to be marked.
