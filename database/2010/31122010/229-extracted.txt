smoothly transferred from the front face sheet to an absorbent without causing pooling or spreading of the body fluid on the front face 
sheet and which shows little back-flow of the liquid, induces no fear of leakage and is free from leakage. A front face sheet for an 
absorbent article having multiple welding-compressed parts, characterized in that the welding-compressed parts are located on the 
lowermost face in the thickness direction of the front face sheet and, on the back side of the front face sheet, the welding-compressed 
parts are surrounded by valleys or low-density sections having the lowest density within the front face sheets. The front face sheet for 
an absorbent article having these welding-compressed parts can be produced by locating a front face sheet between a member having 
multiple peaks and another member having multiple valleys capable of engaging with the preceding multiple peaks and then pressing 
the peaks into the valleys.
