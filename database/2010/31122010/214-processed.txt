Abstract  =>  The present invention relates to a transition arrangement comprising two surface- mountable waveguide parts (4, 5) and a dielectric carrier material (1) with a metalization (M) and a ground plane (G) provide on a respective first main side (2) and second main side (3), the surface-mountable waveguide parts (4, 5) each comprising a first wall (7, 10), a second wall (8, 11), and a third wall (9, 12), which second and third walls (8, 9; 11, 12) are arranged to contact a part of the metalization (M), all the walls (7, 8, 9) together essentially forming a U-shape, the surface-mountable waveguide parts (4, 5) also comprising respective bend parts (20, 21). The metalization (M) on the first main side (2) is removed such that a first aperture (17) and a second aperture (18) are formed, the apertures (17, 18) being enclosed by a frame of via holes (19) electrically connecting the ground plane (G) with the metalization (M), the bend parts (20, 21) being fitted such that the apertures (17, 18) permit passage of a microwave signal propagating via the bend parts (20, 21). Then the dielectric carrier material (1) itself acts as a waveguide transition between the first aperture (17) and the second aperture (18).
