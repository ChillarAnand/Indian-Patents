(57) Abstract : 
An aqueous formulation for topical application to the skin comprising water, a water-miscible organic solvent, and benzoyl peroxide, 
wherein the concentration of the organic solvent is sufficient to provide a stable suspension of benzoyl peroxide in the aqueous 
formulation without the inclusion of a surfactant in the formulation, wherein the ratio of concentrations of water and organic solvent in 
the formulation is sufficient to maintain the benzoyl peroxide in saturated solubility in the formulation following application to the 
skin, and wherein the concentration of benzoyl peroxide in the formulation is less than 5.0% and at least 1.0% w/w. The formulation 
may further contain a chemical compound in addition to benzoyl peroxide that is effective in the treatment of acne. The aqueous 
formulations of the invention are useful in the treatment of acne and acne rosacea.
