(57) Abstract : 
A process for producing an olefin-based polymer, said process comprising polymerizing at least one monomer, in the gas phase, or in 
a slurry process, in the presence of at least the following components: A) at least one catalyst; B) at least one cocatalyst; C) a 
composition comprming at least one compound selected from formula (I), and/or at least one compound selected from formula (11): 
(RICO2)2 A1OH (I), (R2)xN(R3OH)y(II); wherein R1 is a hydrocarbon radical containing from 13 to 25 carbons; R2 is a 
hydrocarbon radical containing from 14 to 26 carbons; R3 is a hydrocarbon radical containing from 1 to 4 carbons; and x + y = 3, and 
x has a value of 1 or 2. A process for producing an olefin-based polymer, said process comprising polymerizing at least one monomer 
in the presence of at least the following components: A) a Ziegler Natta type catalyst comprising at least two transition metals; B) a 
trialkylaluminum compound; C) optionally a composition comprising at least one compound selected from formula (I), and/or at least 
one compound selected from formula (II): (RICO2)2 AIOH (I), (R2)xN(R3OH)y(II); wherein R1 is a hydrocarbon radical containing 
from 13 to 25 carbons; R2 is a hydrocarbon radical containing from 14 to 26 carbons; R3 is a hydrocarbon radical containing from 1 to 
4 carbons; and x + y = 3, and x has a value of 1 or 2.
