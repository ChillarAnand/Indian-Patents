Abstract  =>  The apparatus for monitoring a plurality of work positions (3 to 5) of a ring spinning machine (1) comprises at least one yarn tester (25) which is arranged on a further processing machine (2) for the yarn (22), and a monitoring unit (17) which is connected with the yarn tester (25). In order to ensure a secure, error-free and cost-effective identification of the work positions (3 to 5) of the ring spinning machine (1), a probe (8) is provided which can be guided past the work positions (3 to 5) for receiving signals in a contactless manner, is connected to the monitoring unit (17) and comprises a first sensor (30) for monitoring the work positions and a second sensor (31) for data acquisition on the bobbin tubes (28) at the work positions.
