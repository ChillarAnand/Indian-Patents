(57) Abstract : 
Radio transmission in an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplex, OFDM, based cellular wireless radio transmission system (1), 
wherein radio access equipment (2) of the system connects to multiple geographically spread radio antennas (3, 4, 5) of a Distributed 
Antenna System, DAS, for transmitting to and receiving radio signals from user equipment (6, 7, 8, 9, 10). Transmit timings for radio 
transmission between the user equipment (6, 7, 8, 9, 10) and the antennas (3, 4, 5) of the DAS are established. The radio transmission 
is scheduled based on the established transmit timings.
