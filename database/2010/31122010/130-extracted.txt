(57) Abstract : 
The present invention provides a method of splicing data streams flowing between an encoder and a decoder. The method includes 
accessing a first encoded data stream. The first encoded data stream is encoded by the encoder based upon a first buffer size associated 
with the decoder. The method also includes delaying the first encoded data stream by an offset determined based on a second buffer 
size associated with the decoder. The second buffer size is larger than the first buffer size. The method farther includes splicing one or 
more second encoded data stream(s) into the delayed first encoded data stream.
