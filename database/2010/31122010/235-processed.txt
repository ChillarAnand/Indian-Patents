Abstract  =>  A wearing article, or a diaper, which can be smoothly worn by a wearer even if the wearer is sitting on a chair. Among a front waist region (13) and a rear waist region (14), at least the rear waist region (14) is stretchable. Fastening means (12a, 12b) are constructed from a pair of first fastening elements (25, 26) extending in the longitudinal direction Y on the outer surfaces of first side edges (13a, 13b) of the front waist region (13), and also from a pair of second fastening elements (27, 28) engageable with the first fastening elements (25, 26) and extending in the longitudinal direction Y on the inner surfaces of second side edges (14a, 14b) of the rear waist region (14). To engage the fastening means (12a, 12b) with each other, the first fastening element (26) on one side and the second fastening element (28) corresponding the first fastening element (26) are engaged with each other, the front and rear waist regions (13, 14) are pulled to the other side to stretch at least the rear waist region (14), and, in this state, the first fastening element (25) on the other side and the second fastening element (27) corresponding the first fastening element (25) are engaged with each other. When the engagement is completed, the first and second fastening elements (25, 26, 27, 28) on said side and the other side are engaged with each other with shear strength which does not allow disengagement between the first and second fastening elements (25, 26, 27, 28).
