(57) Abstract : 
Patterned substrates for photovoltaic and other uses are made by pressing a flexible stamp upon a thin layer of resist material, which 
covers a substrate, such as a wafer. The resist changes phase or becomes flowable, flowing away from locations of impression, 
revealing the substrate, which is subjected to some shaping process, typically etching. Portions exposed by the stamp being are 
removed, and portions that protected by the resist, remain. A typical substrate is silicon, and a typical resist is a wax. Workpiece 
textures include extended grooves, discrete, spaced apart pits, and combinations and intermediates thereof. Platen or rotary patterning 
apparatus may be used. Rough and irregular workpiece substrates may be accommodated by extended stamp elements. Resist may be 
applied first to the workpiece, the stamp, or substantially simultaneously, in discrete locations, or over the entire surface of either. The 
resist dewets the substrate completely where desired.
