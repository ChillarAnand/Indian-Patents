(57) Abstract : 
The invention provides a plasma processing apparatus that can uniformly supply a gas between a cathode electrode and an anode 
electrode, even when areas of both electrodes are increased, and that can reduce thicknesses of both electrodes. Two sets of an anode 
electrode 4 and a cathode electrode 12 are arranged in a chamber 15 of a plasma processing apparatus 100 so as to be opposite to each 
other. The cathode electrode 12 has a shower plate 2, a back plate 3, and a hollow room 17. The shower plate 2 is provided with first 
gas-ejection holes 18 for ejecting a gas, which is introduced into the hollow room 17, to a portion between both electrodes 4 and 12. A 
gas introducing port 31 for introducing a gas from an outside is provided at an electrode end face at a lower face (a inner-wall 19 of 
the hollow room 17 opposite to the shower plate 2) of the back plate 3. The inner-wall 19 of the hollow room 17 is provided with 
second gas-ejection holes 32 for ejecting the gas to the hollow room 17, and a gas guiding section 33 for guiding the gas to the second 
gas-ejection holes 32 from the gas introducing port 31.
