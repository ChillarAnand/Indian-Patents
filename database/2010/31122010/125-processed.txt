Abstract  =>  The present invention relates to a method for keeping the routing tables of the nodes of an unstable dissemination network up to date, said nodes joining or leaving said network unpredictably. A node periodically sends a synchronization message to all other remote nodes, the period for sending a synchronization message to all other remote nodes increasing when the network is tending to stabilize, the remote nodes all being synchronized and the local routing table not evolving. A node exceptionally sends a synchronization message to another remote node particularly when said other node is desynchronized. Application: extended heterogeneous networks. Figure 1
