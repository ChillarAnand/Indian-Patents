(57) Abstract : 
The present invention relates to a method for keeping the routing tables of the nodes of an unstable dissemination network up to date, 
said nodes joining or leaving said network unpredictably. A node periodically sends a synchronization message to all other remote 
nodes, the period for sending a synchronization message to all other remote nodes increasing when the network is tending to stabilize, 
the remote nodes all being synchronized and the local routing table not evolving. A node exceptionally sends a synchronization 
message to another remote node particularly when said other node is desynchronized. Application: extended heterogeneous networks.
