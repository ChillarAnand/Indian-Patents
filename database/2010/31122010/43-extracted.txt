(57) Abstract : 
A multistage compressor installation in which compression stages utilizing centrifugal compressors are independently driven by 
drivers that can be electric motors configured to be controlled by a speed controller. Intercoolers are located between stages to remove 
the heat of compression and the stages are connected such that outlets are located opposite to inlets of the compressors and conduits 
connecting the intercoolers to the stages are in an in-line relationship to inhibit the formation of pressure drops between stages. The 
conduits connecting the stages incorporate tapered transition sections configured such that flow velocity gradually decreases towards 
the intercooler and gradually increases from the intercooler to the next succeeding compression stage to further inhibit pressure drops.
