(57) Abstract : 
An invention is described having the form of device for the catalytic coating of surfaces and honeycomb bodies, which as a result of a 
stainless steel powder precoating enables a longer-lasting product, lower sensitivity, a larger temperature application range, and a 
longer service life, and of a method for use in flameless catalytic condensing boilers, in the catalytic post-purification of thermal waste 
air purification systems and as a coating for fuel cell membranes.
