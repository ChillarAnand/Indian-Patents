(57) Abstract : 
This document describes tools capable of enabling cloud-based movable-component binding. The tools, in some embodiments, bind 
protected media content to a movable component in a mobile computing device in a cryptographically secure manner without 
requiring the movable component to perform a complex cryptographic function. By so doing the mobile computing device may 
request access to content and receive permission to use the content quickly and in a cryptographically robust way.
