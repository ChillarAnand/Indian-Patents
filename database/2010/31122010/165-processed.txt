Abstract  =>  A protective device for the neck, such as a neck brace (12), with a substantially rigid closed structure around the neck and adapted to sit on the user’s torso comprises means for temporarily changing the device’s shape so as to reduce the natural gap between the upper brace surface and the lower rim of the helmet (10), thereby creating a supplementary transmission path for compressive forces exerted upon the device towards the torso.
