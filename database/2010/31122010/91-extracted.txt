(57) Abstract : 
An apparatus and method for continuously casting thin steel strip includes a pair of counter-rotatable casting rolls laterally positioned 
to form a nip there between through which thin cast strip can be cast, an actuator for moving each casting roll independently toward 
and away from a reference location as desired, location sensors for sensing the location of the casting rolls relative to the given 
reference location and producing electrical signals indicative of each casting roll position and a control system for receiving the 
electrical signals and causing the actuator to move the casting rolls as desired. Force sensors may be provided for sensing the forces 
exerted on the strip and producing electrical signals indicative of the sensed forces, and the control system may receive the electrical 
signals indicative of the sensed forces and cause actuators to vary the position of the casting rolls responsive to the electrical signals as 
desired.
