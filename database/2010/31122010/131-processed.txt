Abstract  =>  A system and method for onboard train detection is disclosed. In some embodiments, the train detection function is segregated into a safety-critical head-of-train determination, a safety-critical end-of-train (or length-of-train) determination, and a safety-critical train integrity function. By supplementing the train detection and integrity functions with information on system latencies, guard zones, processing delays and a determination of safe braking distance, the method and system provides safety-critical onboard positive train separation information. This information is transmitted to a control center and used to determine safe separation distance between trains.
