(57) Abstract : 
The present invention relates to damper for a medicament delivery device, which device comprises a container containing 
medicament, a stopper arranged in said container and movable for expelling said medicament through a dose delivery means, a 
plunger rod having opposing proximal and distal ends and capable of acting on said stopper, and force means capable of exerting a 
force on said plunger rod, wherein said damper comprises a tubular sleeve having opposing proximal and distal ends; said sleeve 
comprises a compartment formed by a closed end wall at the proximal end of the sleeve and the proximal end of the plunger rod which 
is positioned in an open end at the distal end of the sleeve; and wherein said compartment comprises a sealable and resilient pad, a 
fluid, and at least one passage for expelling said fluid in an annular space between said sleeve and an inner wall of said container, 
thereby creating a dampening force, upon movement of said plunger rod.
