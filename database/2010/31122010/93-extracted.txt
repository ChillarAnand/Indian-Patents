(57) Abstract : 
The subject matter disclosed herein relates to a system and method for obtaining time references for signals received from transmitters 
in a satellite and/or terrestrial navigation system. A first time reference associated with a first signal received at a receiver from a first 
transmitter is obtained. A second time reference associated with a second signal from a second transmitter is obtained based on the 
first time reference and on an estimated difference between a first range to the first transmitter from the receiver and a second range to 
the second transmitter from the receiver.
