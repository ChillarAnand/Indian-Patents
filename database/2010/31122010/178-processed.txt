Abstract  =>  A contoured structure (10) to connect a vehicle pane (40) to a water draining chamber (50) comprises a first segment (20) affixable to the vehicle pane and a second segment (30) fitted with or subtending a snap-in recess (60) serving to detachably install the water draining chamber (50). Said water draining chamber comprises a rib (51) which is frictionally and/or geometrically interlocking into said recess, furthermore at least one seal (90) that, in the installed position of said water draining chamber, subtends a substantially flat and flush transition between the surfaces of the vehicle pane (40) and of the water draining chamber (50). To assure that the water draining chamber can be installed both simply and quickly, without thereby stressing the connection between the contoured structure and the vehicle pane, the invention provides that at least one detent (70) which is designed to facilitate inserting the rib (51) of the water draining chamber (50) into the snap-in recess (60) along a first direction (R1) while extracting the rib (51) out of said snap-in recess (60) in the opposite direction (R2) will encounter greater resistance.
