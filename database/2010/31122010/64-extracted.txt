(57) Abstract : 
The present invention deals with the bioconversion of cellulose from waste cake of Jatropha oilseed, which is a byproduct from a 
biodtescl plant into ethanol by using the methods of acid pretreatment, hydrolysis and fermentation by Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The 
implementations include the novel pretreatment method of the finely ground cellulosic solid oilseed cake with dilute sulphuric acid 
and heating the mixture at a high temperature to break the crystalline structure of the lignocellulose to facilitate the hydrolysis by 
dilute acids. The implementations also involve the hydrolysis of the cellulose content into sugars by dilute acid hydrolysis by a new 
approach that involves incubation period at a high temperature for 72 hours. Finally the implementations also include the fermentation 
of the hydrolyzed waste for sufficient period under proper incubation conditions, to produce ethanol.
