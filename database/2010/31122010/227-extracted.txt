(57) Abstract : 
An oxidation catalyst is described for the exhaust gas purification of utility vehicles with diesel engines, which contains a substrate 
and a catalytically active coating of platinum, active aluminium oxide and aluminium-silicon mixed oxide. The two oxidic support 
materials, aluminium oxide and aluminium-silicon mixed oxide, are catalytically activated with platinum, the majority of platinum 
being present on the active aluminium oxide. The oxidation catalyst is distinguished by good NO oxidation rates together with a high 
poisoning resistance against sulfur compounds.
