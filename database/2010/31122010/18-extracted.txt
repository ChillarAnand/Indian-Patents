A new invention is described that is capable of direct and efficient storage of solar generated energy within the solar cell itself A key 
part of the invention is the additional of one or more additional layers to the cell such as a capacitor or super-capacitor thin film(s) 
and/or thin film battery which is fully integrated with the solar cell. Such additional films can be integrated with any existing solar cell 
concepts, such as a Si wafer cell, Dye Sensitized Solar Cell (DSSC), extra-thin absorber layer (ETA) cells, quantum dot (QD) cells, 
Bulk Heterojunction (BH) cells etc.
