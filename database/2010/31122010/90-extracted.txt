(57) Abstract : 
The invention relates to a method for securing a number n greater than or equal to 1 of messages MUi (i= 1 to n) transmitted by a 
transmitting terminal to a receiving terminal in which, Before  transmitting,  the  transmitting terminal, a- generating an ordered 
sequence comprising N data blocks Bj, (j= 1 to N), where N is an integer number greater than or equal to n; b- for each message 
MUi (i= 1 to n), calculating a position pi in said ordered sequence of N blocks using a function F; c- encapsulating each message MUi 
(i= 1 to n) in block Bj located in position pi, and; d- transmitting  the  ordered  sequence  comprising messages MUi to said receiving 
terminal; and on reception, the receiving terminal; e- recalculating the positions pi (i = 1 to n) of blocks Bj encapsulating 
messages MUi using said function F; f- extracting blocks Bj located at positions pi (i= 1 to n) in the received ordered sequence; g- 
extracting the messages MUi encapsulated in said blocks  Bj.
