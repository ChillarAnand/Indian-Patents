Abstract  =>  The present invention relates to a spherical catalyst support consisting of a thin annular shell of catalytically active material in gamma alumina formed in-situ on and bonded to a non-active inert core. The catalytic support is prepared by wetting an inert non-active core with colloidal aluminum sol, spraying a boehmite/pseudo boehmite powder along with a povvder of water soluble polymer binder on said colloidal aluminum sol wetted inert core to form a coating thereon, neutralising the coated core, and calcining the coated core to convert the boehmite/pseudo boehmite into gamma alumina thereby forming a bond between the thin annular shell of preformed catalytically active material in gamma alumina and the inert, non-active core.
