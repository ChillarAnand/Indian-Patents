(57) Abstract : 
A magnetic testing apparatus (100) is provided with a magnetizing device(1) applying a rotating magnetic field to a material to be 
tested, a detecting device (2) detecting a testing signal, and a signal processing device (3) applying a signal processing to the testing 
signal. The magnetizing device applies an alternating current obtained by superimposing a first current and a second current having a 
lower frequency than the first current as an exciting current. The signal processing device is provided with a first synchronous 
detecting device (31) synchronously detecting a testing signal by using the first current as a reference signal, a second synchronous 
detecting device (32) synchronously detecting an output signal of the first synchronous detecting device by using the second current as 
a reference signal so as to extract a candidate flaw signal, and a testing image display device (34) displaying a testing image in which 
each of pixels has a gray level corresponding to an intensity of the candidate flaw signal at each of positions of the material to be 
tested, and a phase of the candidate flaw signal at each of the positions is capable of being identified.
