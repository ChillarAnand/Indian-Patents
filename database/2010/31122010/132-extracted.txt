The invention relates to an extruded tube for a heat exchanger, comprising two at least approximately parallel outer side walls (1, 2) 
that extend in a longitudinal direction (z) and a transverse direction (y) of the extruded tube and that are connected by means of two 
outer narrow sides (3, 4) in a vertical direction (x) of the extruded tube, wherein at least one continuous web (5) extends between the 
side walls (1, 2) in the longitudinal direction (z) and in the vertical direction (x) and separates at least two ducts (6) of the extruded 
tube, and wherein at least one of the outer side walls (1, 2) has embossings (7) that serve to form both bulged portions (7), that project 
into the ducts (6), of the side walls (1, 2) and also bulged portions (7), that extend substantially in the transverse direction (y), of the 
web (5), wherein the bulged portions (7) of the at least one web (5) have a controlled orientation with respect to the transverse
