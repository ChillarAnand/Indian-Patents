(57) Abstract : 
The disclosure relates to Aeronautics, more particularly relating to wing planforms that reduce wing drag substantially in aircraft 
driven by propellers or other rotors in tractor configuration. An aircraft comprising a wing and propeller system (1), said system 
comprising wing planform (2) characterized into wing chord regions (3) behind each propeller/rotor (5) whose length is relatively 
varied with respect to length of wing chord regions (4) at outboard of the propeller/rotor (5) towards wing tip and/or at inboard of the 
propeller (5) towards fuselage, and plurality of propellers (5) fixed ahead of wing leading edge such that induced drag is reduced by 
exploiting the velocity field generated by the slipstream of the propeller (5). Also, provides for a method of optimizing wing and 
propeller system and a method reducing induced drag, among other possible parameters of interest. FIG. 8
