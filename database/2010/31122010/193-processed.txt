Abstract  =>  The invention relates to a granulated personal care shampoo comprising a shampoo composition comprising at least one surfactant agglomerated with a water-soluble, water- dispersible or water-insoluble solid particulate carrier. Preferably, the shampoo composition additionally contains a conditioner preferably comprising an organopolysiloxane. The granulated shampoo of the invention can dissolve readily with formation of shampoo foam in hot or cold water, and can be perceived as soft in the dry state, free flowing state and providing a pleasant feel on the skin. The granulated shampoo can be packaged in various types of biodegradable packaging such as paper (environmentally more friendly than plastic sachets) to form a stable package which do not deteriorate on storage.
