(57) Abstract : 
Systems and methods for producing ammonia. Nitrogen and hydrogen can be supplied to a reaction zone disposed inside an inner 
shell. The inner shell can be disposed inside an outer shell such that a space is formed therebetween. The reaction zone can include at 
least one catalyst bed in indirect heat exchange with the space. The nitrogen and hydrogen can be reacted in the reaction zone in the 
presence of at least one catalyst to form an effluent comprising ammonia. The effluent can be recovered from the inner shell and 
cooled to provide a cooled effluent stream. A cooling fluid can be provided to the outer shell such that the cooling fluid flows through 
at least a portion of the space and is in fluid communication with the exterior of the inner shell. At least a portion of the cooled 
effluent can provide at least a portion of the cooling fluid. The cooling fluid can then be recovered from the outer shell as an ammonia 
product.
