Abstract  =>  Radio transmission in an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplex, OFDM, based cellular wireless radio transmission system (1), wherein radio access equipment (2) of the system connects to multiple geographically spread radio antennas (3, 4, 5) of a Distributed Antenna System, DAS, for transmitting to and receiving radio signals from user equipment (6, 7, 8, 9, 10). Transmit timings for radio transmission between the user equipment (6, 7, 8, 9, 10) and the antennas (3, 4, 5) of the DAS are established. The radio transmission is scheduled based on the established transmit timings.
