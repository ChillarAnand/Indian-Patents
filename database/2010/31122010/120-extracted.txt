(57) Abstract : 
Systems and methods are disclosed for using two TDD carriers in the same paired spectrum by offsetting the DL and UL 
transmissions in frequency to cause the TDD carriers to behave as two half-duplex FDD carriers. DL and UL transmission and 
reception periods are predefined such that only one of the TDD carriers is transmitting on the DL at any instant in time while the other 
TDD carrier is transmitting on the UL.
