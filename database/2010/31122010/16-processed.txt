Abstract  =>  The disclosure refers to two insecticidal wettable powder compositions containing effective amounts of a juvenile infective-stage of two insecticidal entomopathogenic nematodes, Heterorhabditis indica strain NBAII Hi1 and Heterorhabditis bacteriophora strain NBAII Hb5. The present invention refers to two locally isolated entomopathogenic nematodes of the species Heterorhabditis indica and H. bacteriophora (NBAII Hi1 and NBAII Hb5, respectively, and NCBI accession No.) which are effective biopesticide agents for the control of insects, particularly the larvae or grubs of scarab beetles viz., Anomala bengalensis, Leucopholis lepidophora, L burmestri, Holotrichia serrata etc., Agrotis spp. and soil insect pests. The instant invention also refers to packaging of the wettable powder formulation compositions, useful for storage, transport and field application for the control of soil insect pests, more specifically, whitegrubs of scarabaeidae. The methods and formulations are suitable for production of suitable formulations for long term storage and distribution of nematode preparations. The specific combination of inert silicate minerals as carriers, supported wettable powder formulations of Heterorhabditis indica strain NBAII Hi1 and Heterorhabditis bacteriophora strain Hb5 with a shelf- life of 9-12 months. These biologically active products are environment-friendly, specific to target pests, essential components in IPM and promote value addition through organic fanning. With the growing reports on losses due to white grubs and other soil insect pests in important crops like plantations, banana, groundnut, sugarcane, potato, turmeric etc., on one side, and meager availability of limited or restricted availability of soil insecticides on the other side to control them, biological control has the potential to become a regular component of IPM and thus there is a potential for bulk requirement of good quality, long shelf-life formulations of entomopathogenic nematodes. Therefore, the products and processes as per the claim have potential market against soil insect pests, more specifically against white grubs in different crop situations in developing nations, SAARC countries, world over.
