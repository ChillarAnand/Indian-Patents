(57) Abstract : 
Multipiston monophasic compression engine having working part (W) which comprising the rotor (R) having two components namely 
rotating piston (2) which is connected to central rod (5) and adjusting piston (1) which are arranged circularly around the rotating 
piston (2). These two types of piston forms slid fit with the walls of the stator (F9, f10). This engine has intake port (10) at the top of 
the working chamber and exhaust port (3) between every two adjusting pistons (1). These mechanisms helps in continuous flow of 
compressive pressure inside the engine to get the out put rotational-energy from the central rod (5).
