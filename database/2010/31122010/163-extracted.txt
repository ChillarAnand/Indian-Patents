(57) Abstract : 
Disclosed is a method for introducing a foreign gene into a yeast cell having no auxotrophic marker. Specifically disclosed is a method 
for imparting a target auxotrophy to a yeast cell and introducing a gene to be expressed into the yeast cell. The method comprises the 
step of transforming a yeast cell with an expression cassette for a gene to be expressed, a cassette for a yeast selection marker and a 
fragment containing two homologously recombined fragments which are homologous to regions located on both sides of a target 
auxotrophy-controlling gene in a predetermined array. According to the method, a target auxotrophy-controlling gene can be deleted 
from a yeast cell, a gene to be expressed can be introduced into the yeast cell, and a yeast selection marker can be removed from the 
tansformed yeast cell.
