(57) Abstract : 
A method may include determining a metric for at least one physical resource block of a wireless cellular network in at least a one 
cell. Each physical resource block may include a set of frequencies, and/or the metric may be based on interference on the at least one 
physical resource block in the at least one cell. A determination of whether the metric violates a metric threshold may be made, and an 
overload indicator may be sent to at least one other cell if the metric violates the metric threshold.
