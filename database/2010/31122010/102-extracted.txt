(57) Abstract : 
The invention relates to novel insulin analogs having a basal time-action profile, which are characterized by the following features: a) 
the B chain end consists of an amidated basic amino acid residue such as lysine or arginine amide; b) the N- terminal amino acid 
residue of the insulin A chain is a lysine or arginine radical; c) the amino acid position A8 is occupied by a histidine radical; d) the 
amino acid position A21 is occupied by a glycine radical; and e) one or more substitutions and/or additions of negatively charged 
amino acid residues are carried out in the positions A5, A15, A18, B-l, B0, B1, B2, B3 and B4.
