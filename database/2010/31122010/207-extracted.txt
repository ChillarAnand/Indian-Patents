(57) Abstract : 
The invention pertains to reaction systems in which at least one capillary unit is applied. The capillary unit comprises: -a unit inlet for 
receiving a fluid flow, - a unit outlet for releasing said fluid flow, - a capillary, which capillary is arranged between the unit inlet and 
the unit outlet such that said fluid flow passes through the capillary, - a heater and/or a cooler for adjusting the temperature of the 
capillary and therewith influencing the flow rate of the fluid flow passing through said capillary, - a housing for accommodating at 
least the capillary and heater and/or cooler of said capillary unit, which housing provides thermal insulation of the capillary, - a flow 
sensor for measuring the flow rate of the fluid flow through the capillary unit, which flow sensor can be arranged either inside or 
outside the housing, A capillary unit is combined with or further has a flow adjustment unit for adjusting the flow rates of the 
secondary fluid flows, which flow adjustment unit comprises a temperature control device for individually controlling the heater 
and/or cooler of each capillary unit in response to the flow rate that is measured by the flow sensor of that capillary unit.
