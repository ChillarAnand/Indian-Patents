(57) Abstract : 
Back light sign board with a light glowing only though required area discloses the cost effective method with two layers of sign face 
instead of a single layer of flex sign face in backlight sign boards. Front layer is of any backlight flex with an additional black opaque 
vinyl or opaque black pasted on it from behind. This vinyl or opaque black is reverse cut as per required glowing area which allows 
light to pass only through cut section of black opaque vinyl or opaque black and restricts the light passing through entire sign face. 
Restricted sign area glow reduces number of lights and accordingly reduces the cost of light fixtures along with its reoccurring power 
consumption. This is more useful where expensive light fittings such as LED lights are to be used.
