(57) Abstract : 
A hydraulic cylinder that expands and contracts in accordance with supply and discharge of a working fluid includes: a piston unit that 
is defined in an interior of a cylinder tube to be free to perform a sliding motion within the cylinder tube; and a piston rod in which the 
piston unit is fixed to one end thereof and the other end thereof projects from the cylinder tube, wherein the piston unit is inserted into 
a small diameter portion of the piston rod such that an end surface thereof fixedly contacts a shoulder end surface of the piston rod, a 
round portion is formed as an annular concave in a base end portion outer periphery of the small diameter portion of the piston rod, a 
tapered portion is formed on an inner periphery of the piston unit from the end surface in alignment with an concave portion formed 
by concaving the small diameter portion, and a length of the tapered portion in a piston unit axial direction is equal to or greater than a 
length of the concave portion in a piston rod axial direction.
