(57) Abstract : 
An improved valve element for a spray nozzle assembly of a steam desuperheating device that is configured to spray cooling water 
into a flow of superheated steam in a generally uniformly distributed spray pattern. The valve element comprises a valve body and an 
elongate valve stem that is integrally attached to the valve body and extends axially therefrom. The valve body itself comprises a 
nozzle cone which is integrally connected to the valve stem, and defines an outer surface. Integrally formed on a bottom surface of the 
nozzle cone is a hub having multiple ribs protruding therefrom. Integrally connected to each of the ribs is a generally circular fracture 
ring. The fracture ring is disposed in spaced relation to the lower edge of the nozzle cone which circumvents the bottom surface 
thereof. In this regard, a series of windows are formed in the valve body, with each window being framed by a segment of the lower 
edge of the nozzle cone, an adjacent pair of the ribs, and a segment of the top edge of the fracture ring.
