(57) Abstract : 
Exemplary embodiments of the present invention are directed towards a method of sequentially separating essential cell products from 
a biomass of microalgae. More particularly, the invention is a sequential separation of C-phycocyanin, beta-carotene and gamma-
linolenic acid from biomass obtained from a consortium comprising Spirulina sp. and Dunaliella sp. The invention provides for 
optimization of used biomass to recover said products in a sequential manner, as well involves some improvised methods to enhance 
the recovery of C-phycocyanin, beta- carotene and gamma-linolenic acid with substantial purity.
