(57) Abstract : 
Apparatuses, methods, and systems for reconfiguring some or all content from one or more first containers into a second container are 
provided. In an example of the apparatus, the apparatus has a dispensing system having a dispenser to dispense content from one 
container into another, and a delivery system adapted to reconfigure the dispensed content from the one container into another 
container. In another example, a method includes dispensing selected contents from one container and reconfiguring the dispensed 
contents from the one container into another. In another example, the system includes a controller, a machine controlled by the 
controller, wherein the machine has a pair of container handlers, a content dispenser, and a content delivery system. The controller is 
adapted to control the machine using a selection criterion to operate the content dispenser to dispense selected content from one 
container to move with the delivery system into another container.
