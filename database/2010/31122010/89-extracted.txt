maximizing efficiency in power consumption by securing a constant flow of permeate through the use of a relatively-low negative 
pressure, the header for filtering membrane module comprising a body with a permeate collecting space therein; and a conduit at one 
end of the body, the conduit being in fluid communication with the permeate collecting space, wherein at least a portion of the 
permeate collecting space has an inclined shape.
