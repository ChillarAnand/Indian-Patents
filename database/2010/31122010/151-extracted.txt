(57) Abstract : 
An improved system and method for submitting, distributing and/ or managing digital products with respect to a product distribution 
site are disclosed. The submission of digital products to the product distribution site is able to be performed by numerous submitters in
a uniform and computer- assisted manner. The submitted digital products can then be managed in a largely automated manner and 
made available for online purchase and distribution at the product distribution site. Once a digital product is submitted, the user can 
access the status of the digital product submission to obtain information of whether the digital product has been approved or rejected. 
In one embodiment, the digital products are computer program products (e.g., computer software programs).
