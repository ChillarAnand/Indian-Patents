Abstract  =>  The subject matter disclosed herein relates to a system and method for obtaining time references for signals received from transmitters in a satellite and/or terrestrial navigation system. A first time reference associated with a first signal received at a receiver from a first transmitter is obtained. A second time reference associated with a second signal from a second transmitter is obtained based on the first time reference and on an estimated difference between a first range to the first transmitter from the receiver and a second range to the second transmitter from the receiver.
