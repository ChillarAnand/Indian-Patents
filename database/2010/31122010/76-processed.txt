Abstract  =>  A compound comprising of a nanoparticle - drug complex that can be used to treat diseases caused by mycobacteria spp. is disclosed. The compound has a metallic oxide nanoparticle at the core and the drug in nanoscale is deposited on the nanoparticle core forming a compound. The current invention also describes a method of using this nanoscale compound to be administered in a colloidal suspension form 10 to a living organism of Mycobacteria spp. using In Vitro Ahalysis. Nanoscale Iron oxide coated with nanoscale rifampicin in an appropriate colloidal suspension that can be administered in an intravenous, digestive or respiratory manner is disclosed.
