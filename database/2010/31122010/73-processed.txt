Abstract  =>  A distributed phase shifter capable of changing the phase of a high-frequency signal in a wider band than ever before. The distributed phase shifter comprises an output-side strip conductor which has a shape of a circular arc which is a part of a circular ring and has its both ends serving for output ends, an input-side strip conductor with its one end positioned at the center of the circular ring, a sliding portion which has a shape of a circular arc which is a part of the circular ring and is shorter than the output-side strip conductor, and an arm portion which has a sliding portion at the end and can be turned around the center of the circular ring. An insulating material is interposed between the output-side strip conductor and the circular-arc sliding portion and between the input-side strip conductor and the arm portion. A ring-shaped conductor of the input-side strip conductor and a ring-shaped conductor of the arm portion face each other via the insulating material. The arm portion consists of a first and a second line each of which has its one end connected to the sliding portion and the other end electrically connected to the ring-shaped conductor of the arm portion.
