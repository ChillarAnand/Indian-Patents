(57) Abstract : 
A wearing article in which hook elements of mechanical fasteners are firmly fixed to a chassis and the hook elements and loop 
elements are firmly joined together. These are achieved with a minimum increase in cost. First and second side edges (11, 12) 
extending in the longitudinal direction Y, which intersects the lateral direction X, are respectively formed in front and rear waist 
regions (8, 9). Support members (13, 14) are mounted to those portions of an inner surface sheet (6) which correspond to the first side 
edges (11), and hook elements (15, 16) are mounted to such portions of the inner surface sheet (6) through the support members (13, 
14). Loop elements (17, 18) are mounted to those portions of the inner sheet (6) which correspond to the second side edges (12). The 
entire regions of the first and second hook elements (15, 16) include deforming sections (19) formed by pressing.
