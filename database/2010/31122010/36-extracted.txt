(57) Abstract : 
The present invention relates a system for digital intermediate frequency (IF) processing, said system comprises spot frequency 
generator to generate sine waveform using frequency clock source, wherein the sine waveform is in predetermined IF range, FPGA 
based waveform generator to generate waveforms using interpolation method, wherein the waveform generated is at a frequency 
generated by the frequency generator, and plurality of channels for performing digital down conversion on the generated radar 
waveforms. Also the method to perform digital IF processing is provided.
