Abstract  =>  The invention relates to oil-in-water emulsions, methods of making said emulsions and their uses in fabric care or hair care compositions. The febric care composition comprises a silicone oil-in-water emulsion which emulsion is obtained by a. forming an oil phase by mixing at least one silicone compound with at least one silicone-free oil, b. optionally adding an emulsifier, c. adding water, d. forming an oil-in-water emulsion. A silicone oil, comprising a siloxane or polysiloxane compound, for example polydimethyl siloxane (polydimethyl silicone or PDMS), or a derivative thereof, e.g., amino and amido silicone, diluted with a silicone-free oil still can provide an emulsion providing high febric care properties while decreasing the costs.
