Abstract  =>  A stripper with multiple gating runners and the method of making the same utilizing an upper plate, an intermediate plate, and a lower plate sequentially stacked on a platform of an injection molding press. Wherein, a feeding bucket between the upper and the intermediate plates injects a compound into the lower plate. When the compound entirely fills primary runners, sub-runners, and feeding chutes, the bottom ends of pullers would connect with the primary runners after the compound is solidified. Thus, while releasing the mold, the pullers would previously pull the solidified primary runners from the two outmost sides toward the center, so that the connected solidified sub-runners would be gradually divided from the lower plate, and the present invention favorably achieves an effort saving efficiency with a stable stripping runner system.
