(57) Abstract : 
The present invention relates to a hydro thermal carbonization process for the preparation of coal-like material using biomass. The 
process comprises a step (i) of heating a reaction mixture comprising water and biomass to obtain a reaction mixture comprising 
activated biomass; and a step (ii) of adding a polymerization initiator to the reaction mixture obtained in step (i) to polymerize the 
activated biomass and to obtain a reaction mixture comprising coal-like material. The process is beneficial in terms of product control, 
and process engineering.
