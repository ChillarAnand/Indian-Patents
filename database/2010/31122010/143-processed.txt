Abstract  =>  A low-profile surgical stapler enables a large-sized staple to be delivered into a body cavity through a small opening or port. The surgical stapler includes a handle having a trigger movably coupled to the handle. The surgical stapler also includes an elongated, tubular shaft extends distally from the handle. The tubular shaft includes a proximal end secured to the handle and a distal end in which a deployment opening is formed. A staple deploying assembly is disposed within an interior of the shaft for discharging staples from the deployment opening at the distal end of the shaft, the staple deploying assembly supporting a staple such that a longitudinal axis of the staple is aligned with a longitudinal axis of the shaft. The deployment opening is shaped and dimensioned to permit the deployment of the staples from within the shaft, out of the deployment opening and into adjacent tissue.
