Abstract  =>  To provide a method of efficiently compressing information by performing improved removal of signal correlations according to statistical and local properties of a video signal in a 4:4:4 format which is to be encoded, an image encoding device for dividing each picture of a digital video signal into predetermined unit regions, and carrying out, for each of the predetermined unit regions, compression encoding using a motion compensation prediction includes: a prediction unit for searching for a motion vector based on virtual-pixel-accuracy specification information for specifying an upper limit of an accuracy of a pixel position indicated by the motion vector, and generating, based on the motion vector that is searched for, a motion-compensation predicted image; and an encoding unit for multiplexing the virtual-pixel-accuracy specification information with a bit stream, and multiplexing, based on a magnitude of the motion vector that is searched for and a magnitude of a motion vector used for prediction of the motion vector that is searched for, motion vector data to be encoded with the bit stream.
