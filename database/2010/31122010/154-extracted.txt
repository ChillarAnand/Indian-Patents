(57) Abstract : 
Various methods and apparatus for treating a condition associated with impaired glucose regulation in a subject comprising in one 
embodiment, applying a neural conduction block to a target nerve at a blocking site with the neural conduction block selected to at 
least partially block nerve pulses. In another embodiment, combinations of down-regulating and or up-regulating with or without 
pharmaceutical agents are used to treat impaired glucose regulation. In other embodiments, up-regulation or down-regulation of 
various nerves, such as the vagus and its branches, and the splanchnic is used to modify the production of GLP-1 and GIP, thereby 
controlling glucose levels. In yet further embodiments, combinations of down-regulating and or up-regulating with or without 
pharmaceutical agents are used to modify the production of GLP-1 and GIP, to treat impaired glucose regulation.
