Abstract  =>  A method and a device for reselecting a cell are provided in an embodiment of the present invention. The method includes: reselecting a cell by using a user priority parameter delivered by a source cell and received by a terminal, after the terminal resides in a target cell and before the terminal obtains a user priority parameter delivered by the target cell. The technical solution provided in an embodiment of the present invention involves reselecting a cell by using user priority parameters delivered by a source cell before user priority parameters delivered by the target cell are obtained. In this way, more proper priority parameters are correctly selected during a process for reselecting a priority cell, and the user is enabled to select an expected resident cell through the process for reselecting a priority cell.
