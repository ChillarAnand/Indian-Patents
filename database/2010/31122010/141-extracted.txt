(57) Abstract : 
The invention relates to a furnace system, comprising a furnace (1), particularly an arc furnace, for melting metal, a cleaning device 
(3) for removing and/or avoiding bulk goods from or in a furnace opening (2), wherein the cleaning device (3) comprises a movable 
thrust arm (4) for carrying out a thrust movement, and means (6) for moving the thrust arm (4) between a parking level (P) and an 
operating level (B). The invention provides a furnace system, in which the use of a furnace opening is further made more flexible in 
that a work platform (7) forming a work level (A) is present, from which the furnace opening (2) is accessible and which carries the 
cleaning device (3), and wherein the work level (A) has a recess (8) through which the thrust arm (4) can be guided during the 
movement thereof between the operating level (b) positioning above the work level (A), and the parking level (P) positioned below the 
working level (A).
