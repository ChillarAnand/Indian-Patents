The invention concerns a filtering drum (1) for fibre suspensions in water, comprising a plurality of shaped bars (2; 11, 13) with 
mainly longitudinal development, arranged side by side in order to define a tubular structure having substantially circular cross 
section, with the inner lateral surface (4) covered by a plurality of slits (3) that create a filtering surface, two or more annular elements 
(15) coaxial with one another and spaced according to the longitudinal axis (X) defined by the tubular structure, coupled through 
contact outside the shaped bars (2; 11, 13), wherein the shaped bars (2; 11, 13) are arranged according to a helical pattern.
