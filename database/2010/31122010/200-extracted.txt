(57) Abstract : 
A problem with high resource-consuming managed copy is that simultaneous execution of the managed copy, which is controlled by a 
playback device, and a BD-J application, which is recorded on a recording medium, leads to a shortage in resources. Provided is a 
playback device that enables simultaneous execution of the managed copy and the BD-J application while preventing resource 
contention therebetween, by imposing an access limitation on the disc medium by causing the BD-J application to assume that the disc 
medium has been virtually ejected.
