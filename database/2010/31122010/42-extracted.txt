(57) Abstract : 
According to one embodiment, there is provided a multistage-pressure condenser, including a first condenser, a second condenser and 
a third condenser, which are arranged in increasing order of internal pressure, the first condenser and the second condenser each 
including a first partition in which perforations from which condensate obtained by condensing turbine steam by cooling water drops 
are formed on a cooling water inflow side of the condenser rather than at a central part thereof, and a second partition which partitions 
a reheating room for reheating condensate dropping from the perforations in a direction perpendicular to an inflow direction of the 
cooling water, and a heating-steam flow path which supplies heated steam from the third condenser to the reheating room partitioned 
by the first partition and the second partition.
