(57) Abstract : 
The invention relates to a dry-type transformer comprising at least one high-voltage winding and at least one low-voltage winding 
which interact by means of an electromagnetic field. Every winding is constituted of winding conductors, the high-voltage winding 
and the low-voltage winding having a defined distance to each other, spacers (10) being provided between the windings to maintain 
said distance. The invention further relates to a method for producing the spacers (10).
