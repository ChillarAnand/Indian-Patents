(57) Abstract : 
Oral hygiene is very important for maintaining health. Cleaning and massaging spaces in between teeth is as important as using a tooth 
brash regularly. When a person uses interdental brush on the advice of his dentist he feels hurt as and when the bent end of the very 
thin wire which is used for making interdental brush touches his gums. This invention makes this end not only soft and comfortable 
but it also helps in massaging spaces in between teeth.
