(57) Abstract : 
Disclosed is a method for storing an identifier in a first station having a secure non-volatile data store protected by cryptographic data, 
an identifier flag for indicating that the identifier has been written to the secure data store, and an authenticated trust agent that 
prohibits writing of an identifier to the secure data store if the identifier flag is set. In the method, the identifier is written to the secure 
non-volatile data store, wherein the identifier written to the secure data store is encrypted using the cryptographic data. The identifier 
flag is irreversibly set after writing the identifier to the secure data store so that the trust agent prohibits another write of an identifier 
to the secure data store.
