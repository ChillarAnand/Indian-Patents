(57) Abstract : 
Provided are methods for processing a green body that includes compacted metal powder, comprising impacting the green body with a 
particulate material for a time and under conditions effective to displace a portion of the metal powder from the green body. The 
present methods can be used to prepare green bodies that have roughened surfaces and that can be used to make orthopedic implants 
displaying low movement relative to bone when installed in situ, which corresponds to higher stability upon implantation and 
decreases the time required for biological fixation of the implant. Also provided are implants comprising a metallic matrix, and 
methods comprising surgically installing an implant prepared from a surface roughened green body in accordance with the present 
invention.
