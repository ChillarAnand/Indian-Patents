(57) Abstract : 
A tension adjustment structure for fabric winding machine includes a driving mechanism (20), a roller (30), a fabric pressing 
mechanism (40) and an adjustment mechanism. The roller (30) and the driving mechanism (20) have corresponding transmission 
wheels (101, 102) strode by a belt (103). The driving mechanism (20) drives the roller (30) to roll up a fabric (90). The fabric pressing 
mechanism (40) has an action arm (41) and a-fabric pressing bar (42) located on the action arm (41). The fabric pressing bar (42) has a 
first position without in contact with the fabric (90) and a second position in contact with the fabric (90) and lifted by the fabric. The 
adjustment mechanism is butted by the action arm (41) when the fabric pressing bar (42) is at the first position to butt the belt (103) 
and increase initial rolling force of the roller (30). The action arm (41) releases the belt (103) while the fabric pressing bar (42) is at 
the second position so that fabric rolling tightness can be controlled.
