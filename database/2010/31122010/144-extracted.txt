(57) Abstract : 
A tissue conveyor includes a conveyor body having a proximal end and a distal end. The proximal end includes a handle allowing for 
operator control of an end effector located at the distal end. The end effector includes a grasper assembly composed of a first jaw bar 
and a second jaw bar connected by a support base to define a cavity into which tissue is drawn. A first conveyor member is positioned 
upon the first jaw bar for movement along an internal surface of the first jaw bar and a second conveyor member is positioned upon 
the second jaw bar for movement along an internal surface of the second jaw bar. The method for creating a tissue fold includes 
positioning a tissue conveyor adjacent tissue, pushing the respective first jaw bar and the second jaw bar into the tissue in the area 
where a fold is desired, and pulling the first conveyor member and the second conveyor member proximally to draw the first and 
second conveyor members and tissue into a cavity defined by the first jaw bar and the second jaw bar to create a tissue fold.
