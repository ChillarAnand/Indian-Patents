(57) Abstract : 
The present invention relates to a substrate having one or more antimicrobial or antistatic properties. Such, properties are imparted by 
applying a coating or film formed from a cationically-charged polymer composition. The polymer composition includes a noncationic 
ethylenically unsaturated monomer and an ethylenically unsaturated monomer capable of providing a cationic charge to the polymer 
composition. Optionally, the polymer composition includes a steric stabilization component incorporated into the cationically- charged 
polymer composition. The present invention also relates to a personal care product and polymeric material comprising a base polymer 
blended with the above cationically- charged polymer composition.
