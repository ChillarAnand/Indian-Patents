(57) Abstract : 
A positioning device of a position sensor that does not require re-positioning and re-fastening at the time of mounting the position 
sensor. A positioning tool provided with a driving section and a positioning section is mounted on a position sensor. Then, positioning 
projections of the positioning section are engaged with neutral position grooves. In this state, the positioning section is rotated by the 
driving section so as to have the position sensor rotated together until the R-contact turns ON, so that an angle from N to R, i.e. from a 
neutral position to a reverse contact ON position is measured. Thereafter, the positioning section is rotated in an opposite direction to 
measure an angle from N to D, i.e. from a reverse contact OFF position to a drive contact ON position. Based on the measurement 
result, the positioning section is re-rotated by the driving section to move the position sensor to a proper neutral position. The position 
sensor is fastened in this condition.
