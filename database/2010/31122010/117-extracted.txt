(57) Abstract : 
System of evaluating security of script content. A processor executes computer- executable instructions for defining a policy for the 
script content in a web page. The script content provides interactions between a user and other content within the web page. The 
defined policy indicates an execution boundary of the script content. The processor further evaluates the script content against the 
execution boundary in the defined policy. At run time, the processor transforms at least a portion of the web page in response to the 
evaluating. An interface transmits the web page with the transformed portion of the script content to be rendered in an application on a 
host device.FIG.1
