Abstract  =>  The present invention relates to a hydro thermal carbonization process for the preparation of coal-like material using biomass. The process comprises a step (i) of heating a reaction mixture comprising water and biomass to obtain a reaction mixture comprising activated biomass; and a step (ii) of adding a polymerization initiator to the reaction mixture obtained in step (i) to polymerize the activated biomass and to obtain a reaction mixture comprising coal-like material. The process is beneficial in terms of product control, and process engineering.
