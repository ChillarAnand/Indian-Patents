Abstract  =>  The present invention describes a lipid nanovesicle encapsulating a pharmaceutical formulation of paclitaxel. The lipid nanovesicle is a combination of two phospholipids viz DPPC and DOPE. The nanovesicles achieve a stealth character without the addition of any polymers. The nanovesicles show an increased efficacy in drug resistant cancers by bypassing p glycoprotein efflux. The drug release from the nanovesicle is both temperature and pH triggered. The said formulation is administered both as an aerosol and an intravenous formulation and offers a high therapeutic efficacy.
